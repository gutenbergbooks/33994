<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This preface shall be a personal explanation. The
following book was written during the winter of 1876-77,
more than eighteen years ago. Its origin was in this
wise: Some of my readers will know that for more than
twenty years I have studied the habits of our spider
fauna. During the first years of these studies, the
thought came to me to write a book for youth wherein
my observations should be personified in the imaginary
creatures of fairy lore, and thus float into the young
mind some of my natural history findings in such pleasant
form that they would be received quite unconsciously,
and at least an impression thereof retained with sufficient
accuracy to open the way to more serious lessons in the
future.</p>

<p>It further seemed to me that the fairies of Scotland,
with whom I had been familiar from childhood, might
afford vivid personalities for my plan. Accordingly, the
spiders were assigned the part of Pixies or goblins, the
ill-natured fairies of Scotland and Northern England.
The Brownies, or friendly folk, the "gude neebours," or
household fairies, were made to personify those insect
forms, especially those useful to man, against which
spiders wage continual war. Moreover, to express the
relations of the lower creatures to human life, and their
actual as well as imaginary interdependence, human
characters were introduced, and conflicts between Pixies
and Brownies were interwoven with their behaviour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>This purely personal statement has been intruded upon
the reader to explain that the Brownies, as represented
in this book, are not imitations. They antedated, by a
number of years, the popular creations of Mr. Palmer
Cox. The writer well understands as a naturalist that
priority depends not upon originality of intention or invention,
or even of preparation, but upon precedence in
publication. It will be found, however, that my conception
and treatment of these wee folk differ from those of
Mr. Cox. As they appear to me from the recollections
of childhood, they have a more serious aspect, a more
human-like nature, which ought not to be wholly sacrificed
to their jovial characteristics. I have therefore
presented the Brownies as beings with humanized affections,
passions and methods reflected in miniature.</p>

<p>I confess some qualms, on the scientific side of my
conscience, at compelling my friends, the spiders, to play
the part of Pixies. But there seemed no other course
out of regard both to common belief and the necessity
imposed by the facts. As I went on with the work, I
wondered at the ductility with which the current habits
of the aranead tribes yielded to personification. The
water spiders permitted the introduction of smugglers,
pirates and sailors; the burrowing and trapdoor spiders
opened up tales of caves and subterranean abodes; the
ballooning spiders permitted an adaptation of modern
military methods of reconnoissance; and so on through
a long list of aranead habits.</p>

<p>In order to make this more apparent, and to give
adult readers, parents and teachers, and the older class
of youthful readers, a scientific key to the various situations,
brief notes have been added in an Appendix, to
which foot-note references have been made in most of
the chapters. Moreover, the natural habits personified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
are interpreted by figures set into the text with no explanation
but the legend written thereunder.</p>

<p>The crudely drawn cuts which figure in the pages as
"The Boy's Illustrations" are exact reproductions of
sketches made by a lad in my own family, between eight
and nine years old, to whom, with others, the manuscript
was read as a sort of test of its quality. Encouraged
by the advice of one of the keenest and most sympathetic
students of child life in America, I have ventured
to give a few of these drawings to the public, as a curious
study in the operations of child-mind.</p>

<p>I had agreed with myself not to print the Brownie
Book until my scientific work upon the spiders was
finished, and the manuscript remained untouched until
the winter of 1885-6. At that time I seemed to see the
nearing end of my studies, and portions of the Brownie-Pixie
story were distributed to various artists, among
them Mr. Dan. C. Beard and Mr. Harry L. Poore.
Some of the illustrations at that time made, appear in
the following pages, bearing date 1886. "Tenants of
an Old Farm" had now appeared, and was so well received
that it was thought advisable to connect this book
with that by an "Introductory Chapter" intended for
older readers, and which gives the key to the motive of
the story. Early in 1886 I recalled all contracts and
arrangements for publication, as a prolonged sickness
compelled me to drop scientific work and defer the issue
of the "American Spiders." On the very day that the
binders placed the first finished copy of the third and
last volume of that work in my hands, the "copy" of
"Old Farm Fairies" went to the printer.</p>

<p class="chapname">THE SCHOOLMISTRESS AND THE FAIRIES.</p>


<p>In the south yard of the Old Farm at Highwood
there stands a noble Elm tree. Its massive proportions,
the stately pose of its furrowed trunk and the graceful
outlines of its drooping branches have often drawn my
pleased eyes and awakened admiration. There is nothing
in Nature that better serves to stir up human enthusiasm
than a fine tree; and as our vicinage for miles
around abounds in worthy examples of American forest
growths, there is ample opportunity for such sentiment
to be kept aglow in the hearts of the Tenants at the Old
Farm. Yet it must be confessed that there is also occasion
at times for a kindling of quite another sort, when
the stupidity, perversity, and penuriousness of men wage
a vandal war against the noble monarchs of the woods.</p>

<p>The fall of a huge tree is a touching sight. See! the
trunk trembles upon the last few fibres that stand in the
gap which the axman has made. A shiver runs through
the foliage to the summit and circumference of the
branches. The tree-top bows with slightest trace of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
lurch to one side. Then it sinks&mdash;slowly, faster, fast!
With no undignified rush, but with a stately sweep it
descends to the earth. Crash! The ground trembles at
the fall. The nethermost branches in their breakage
explode sharply like a farewell volley of soldiers over a
comrade's grave. Boughs, twigs and leaves vibrate, as
with a passionate earnestness of grief, for a few moments,
and then are still. There, prone upon the forest mould
the glorious monarch lies, majestic even in its fallen
estate. A few bunches of human muscle, a keen steel
edge and a scant fraction of time have destroyed two
centuries of Nature's cunning work.</p>

<p>Well, one is inclined to so vary the version of a certain
Scripture Text that it shall read "a man was infamous"
rather than "a man was famous according as
he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Of course Mr. Gladstone, and the multitude of undistinguished
axmen who delight to fall a tree, have an
honorable and lawful vocation. Trees ripen, like other
animate things, and when they are full ripe they may be
felled; when their time has come they ought to fall;
when the exigencies of higher intelligences truly require,
they also must fall before their time. But, this
brings no justification of that murderous idiocy which
sets so many citizen sovereigns of America to slaughtering
the grand sovereigns of the plant world.</p>

<p>However, all this perhaps has little to do with our
great Elm, except, that one must be grateful that it has
been spared to cause the eyes to rejoice in its beauty
and to refresh us with its shade. We built a rustic seat,
against its trunk, and there in the warm summer days
and evenings which succeeded the winter of our coming
to the Old Farm, I was wont to sit and meditate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
sometimes doze. It was a favorite spot with me, but
others of the family often shared it with me, or enjoyed
it by themselves. This will well enough introduce a
matter which I have now to lay before the reader. It
came to me from the Schoolmistress, who, I venture to
hope, is not forgotten by the readers of "The Tenants
of An Old Farm."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noindent">My dear Mr. Mayfield:</p>

<p>The package that I herewith send you has a strange
history which I beg to recite ere you break the wrappings
and examine the contents of the parcel.</p>

<p>It happened during one of the warm days of last
June that I sat on the rustic bench under the Great
Elm and read Mr. Lowell's "Vision of Sir Launfal."
I closed the book and thought, with an exquisite sense
of its beauty and fitness, upon the poet's opening verses
which contain a description of June, and in which are
these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis Heaven alone that is given away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">'Tis only God may be had for the asking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">There is no price set on the lavish Summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">And June may be had by the poorest comer."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As I conned the words my eyes slowly wandered
along the landscape, and my heart rejoiced in the royal
bounty of beauty which the poet sings. Then my vision
returned to the objects just around me, and gradually
became fixed upon some of the living things
about which you have kindly told us so much new and
interesting. Indeed, they seemed already like old friends,
and I watched with keen zest their various movements.</p>

<p>How bright everything was, and how peaceful the
tone of Nature! Butterflies flitted by, beating the air in
their leisurely way, then rested on leaf or flower while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
they opened and closed their wings with graceful, fanlike
movements. The winged Hymenoptera dashed by
with the sharp, quick wingstroke of their kind, or hung
humming above the flowers. Honey-bees, Carpenter-bees,
Digger-wasps, the blue Mud-dauber, the brown
Paper-wasp, Hornets and Yellow-jackets were busy at
their various occupations. One dusted pollen into its
"basket;" another dumped aromatic pellets of sawdust
from a cedar rail; another scooped up mandible hodfulls
of mortar at the edge of the brook; others plucked
chiplets of old wood from a weathered fence post; all
seemed happy, and devoted to peaceful industry.</p>

<p>The great green Grasshopper was in hearing, if not
in sight, the veritable "hopper" whose long threadlike
antennæ and wedge shaped head you have taught us to
recognize as marking the true from the so called grasshopper
or locust. He sat upon the tall grass on the
bank of the Run close by the spring house, and shrilled
his piping love call to his mate. The annual Cicada,
too ("Pruinosa" you called it), was sounding his amorous
drum from the trees with a volume and sharpness of
sound that far exceed those of his cousin german the
Seventeen Year Cicada. His silent ladylove might
occasionally be seen flitting from bough to bough. An
Orbweaving spider's web was spun upon an adjacent
bush, and three courtiers were established at different
parts of the margin of the snare awaiting the complaisance
of Madam Aranea the housekeeper. Near my feet
a bevy of Fuscous Ants<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> were tugging with great to-do
at a crumb of sweet cake, while their fellow formicarians
were equally concerned in covering and screening
the gate of their nest that lay to the right under the
verge of the Elm's shadow. Birds of several species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
were near by; Robins whistled in the meadow, a Vireo
sang in the tree tops, Sparrows twittered around the
birdcote; Hens cackled in the barnyard, and wakened
the hearty, answering "Tuk-aw, tuk-aw!" of the
big red Rooster. Out in the lane Sarah's conch shell
was sending a melodious call to Hugh whom the Mistress
had bidden her to summon from the wood pasture.
The whole aspect of Nature, indeed, was so charming
that I was soothed into a delicious repose of body and
mind.</p>

<p>I am conscious, dear Sir, that I shall lay a heavy tax
upon your credulity by what I am now to relate. Or,
perhaps, you will smile and say that your friend Abby
has fallen to dreams and visions, and like some of
her young pupils has imagination so little disciplined as
to be quite unable to distinguish between a vivid waking
fancy or dream of sleep, and a real occurrence.
Very well, I must bear your unbelief as best I may, and
at all events you will listen to my story.</p>

<p>Will you believe that among the Tenants of our Old
Farm is a nation of Fairies? You have not suspected
their existence heretofore; but then, neither did I suspect
that legions of curious beings are all around us
until the wand of your knowledge had touched my eyes,
and opened them to the wonderful life histories that are
being wrought out among our fellow tenants of the insect
world.</p>

</div>

<p>Such, at least, was my own thought as I saw several
wee dainty bodies spring from the backs of some Honey-bees
hovering over the white clover, after the fashion
of a rider dismounting from his horse, and another
group alight from a bevy of yellow Butterflies that fluttered
low down and just above the walk. They were
joined by many others of like appearance, who suddenly
emerged from the grass, from the flower border, from
the drooping leaves of the Elm, and approached me.
They clambered up the English Ivy that clings to the
south side of the tree; they climbed upon the rustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
bench, and a few even ventured upon the gnarled arm
against which my elbow rested. This seemed a novel
occurrence, certainly; but I assure you that I was rather
pleased than surprised thereby, for it at once linked
itself with your strange histories of insects, and seemed
a natural and matter-of-course affair. Really, I have
come to think that Nature has so many rare and beautiful
facts hidden away in her secret places that one must
never be surprised to see or hear of the most marvelous
happenings. One of the brightest and most prettily
robed of these tiny people, who seemed to be a sort of
queen among them, drew quite near and addressed me.</p>

<p>"You are not alarmed at our appearance. Good!
Fairies do not visit those who doubt or fear them. We
are pleased to see you smile upon us. Thanks! We
give you greeting! Would you like to know who we
are? Yes? Well, we are called Brownies. Our folk
came from Scotland. You know where that is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I replied, speaking, I suppose, quite mechanically,
"Scotland is the northern part of the island
of Great Britain; it is bounded on the south by England,
on the east by the Ger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the boundary," interrupted the Brownie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
with a dainty, tinkling laugh, "we are not a Schoolmistress
and her Committee, and you needn't say your
lesson now. It's enough for us that you know where
Scotland is,&mdash;the dear auld land o' cakes! We're
Scotch fairies&mdash;Brownies."</p>

<p>"But how came you here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! there's nothing odd about that; we follow our
wandering Sawnies wherever they go. We have all
been interested with you in Mr. Mayfield's accounts of
insect life, and have been present at many of your
walks and talks when you little suspected such company.
Ah! we could give the Tenant some hints well worth
following up! Although, he does very well, very well
indeed! But we wish you to know that there are other
tenants on the old farm than those Mr. Mayfield knows.
<i>We</i> are here, you see! And, alack-a-day! there are
other folk here not so agreeable as we!"</p>

<p>"Many thanks," I said, "for the pleasure of your
acquaintance. I am delighted and honored by your
action, Madam&mdash;Madam? what shall I call you?"</p>

<p>"Fancy; Queen Fancy, if you please; so I am called,
although, to be sure, there is not much royal state among
our folk."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Madam Fancy! And now I&mdash;fancy
that I can explain the beautiful repose that lies
over the face of Nature in this royal month of June. I
have just been meditating upon it with delight. How
peaceful, how lovely in their peacefulness are all things
around us! Yes, I see how it is! The good Brownies
are abroad upon the landscape, and they have thrown
the light and sweetness of their own natures upon these
scenes. What a happy people you are, free from all
conflict and care, and how happy those who feel the
spell of your influence!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! O-o-oh!" A chorus of exclamations uttered
in a deprecating tone broke from the whole Brownie
company.</p>

<p>I started, and looked around surprised beyond measure
at this outburst of protesting voices. Then followed a
moment of silence.</p>

<p>Queen Fancy spoke at last. "Yes, it is just as I
supposed," she said. "You are yet a novice in Nature
lore. You have much to learn, all you mortals have,
ere you can know the true life of the inferior creatures.
There is another side to Nature, I assure you, a very
sad side, too. Come, I must teach you to read between
the lines!"</p>

<p>She touched me with a tiny staff or wand. My mind
at once was wide awake and all its faculties more alert
than usual. But, curiously, the Brownies had disappeared!
I wondered at this, but presently a series of
incidents caught my attention which for the time quite
banished all thought of my new acquaintances.</p>

<p>A long line of Sanguine Ants,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> the Red Slavemakers,
filed by me in irregular columns and crossed
the walk to their nest which, as you know, is placed
close by the fence nearly opposite the barn. The warriors
carried in their jaws the plunder of a nest of
Fuscous Ants which I have already said lies to the
right under the verge of the Elm's shadow. Some
warriors had yellowish cocoons, some white larvæ, a
few carried the bodies (living or dead I could not determine)
of their victims, and several bore upon their
legs the severed heads of the poor blacks who had been
slain in defence of their home, and whose decapitated
heads still clung to their foes fixed in the rigor of death.
I rose and followed up the column of Sanguines to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
nest which they were plundering. Some of the kidnappers
were plunging into the opened gates, others
issuing therefrom laden with their stolen booty, others
were engaged in fierce battle with groups of the invaded
Fuscas. Only a few of the latter were inclined to fight.
They seemed, for the most part, dazed by their misfortune.
Numbers hung to the topmost leaves and stalks
of the surrounding grass and weeds, holding in their
jaws baby larvæ and cocoon cradles rescued from the
invaders, with
which they had
hurriedly fled to
the nearest elevated
objects. It
was truly a pitiful
sight, and I
began to wax indignant
at the Sanguine wretches who could work
such domestic misery and ruin.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/fig_003.jpg" width="275" height="127" alt="Fig. 3.&mdash;A Red Slavemaker Ant with its Plunder." title="Fig. 3.&mdash;A Red Slavemaker Ant with its Plunder." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;A Red Slavemaker Ant with its Plunder.</span>
</div>

<p>"Ah!" said a faint voice close by my ear, "yet this
is Nature!"</p>

<p>I could see no one, but recognized the tone of Queen
Fancy. "True, most true!" I thought, and looked
further. A little way from the Fuscas' nest, just outside
the circle of confusion, I saw a solitary ant of an amber
hue, the Schaufuss ant,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> which you have told us is also
sometimes enslaved. She was moving back and forth
with cautious mien, and I easily perceived was putting
finishing touches to the closure of a little hole that
marked the gate of her formicary hut. A tiny pebble
was placed, then a few pellets of soil were added. Then
the worker walked away, took a few turns as though
surveying the surroundings, and cautiously came back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
The coast was clear! Now she deftly crawled into the
small open space, and I could see from the movements
inside, and an occasional glimpse of a tip of her antennæ,
that she was completing the work of concealment
from the inside. At last her task was done, and all was
quiet. Just then a single Sanguine warrior, perhaps a
straggler from the invaders' army, or some independent
scout, it may be, approached the spot. It walked about
the nest, which certainly looked much like the surrounding
surface; sounded or felt here and there with its
antennæ; passed over the very door into which the
Schaufuss ant had disappeared, and although it evidently
had its suspicion awakened, at last moved away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_004.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="Fig. 4.&mdash;&quot;It was Swathed Like a Mummy at Last&quot; (p. xxiii)." title="Fig. 4.&mdash;&quot;It was Swathed Like a Mummy at Last&quot; (p. xxiii)." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;"It was Swathed Like a Mummy at Last" (p. xxiii).</span>
</div>

<p>"Good!" I exclaimed heartily. "Baffled, Sir Sanguine,
baffled! I am glad that the instinct of home
protection has proved too much for your wretched kidnapping
cunning!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" again spoke the voice of my unseen
fairy, "baffled this time, perhaps. But can you be sure
that the slaveholder scout will not be back again, with
a host of its fellows, and do its work more surely?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/fig_005.jpg" width="320" height="450" alt="Fig. 5.&mdash;The Orbweaver Captured by a Wasp." title="Fig. 5.&mdash;The Orbweaver Captured by a Wasp." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;The Orbweaver Captured by a Wasp.</span>
</div>

<p>I had not thought of that, and indeed, I was pained
to think it when suggested. Now I left the two nests,
the plundered one and its preserved neighbor, and followed
the column of Sanguines which stretched a nearly
straight line of red and black for several rods, to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
home. The kidnappers were bearing their prey into
the open gates. Look at this! Crowds of blacks in a
high state of agitation came forth to meet and greet the
plunderers of their own fellows!
Yes, these were the domesticated
slaves of the Sanguines, themselves
Fuscous ants, the same species and
perhaps from the very nest that
was now being desolated. And
there they were rejoicing in the
booty, welcoming home the robbers,
and if naturalists tell us
truly, had even urged them forth
upon the Expedition.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 138px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;"The Clay Sarcophagus on Yonder Barn."</span>
</div>

<p>"That's the worst of all!" I
exclaimed aloud, unable to suppress
my indignation. "One
might find excuse for the Sanguines, but for this unnatural
behavior&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unnatural!" echoed the unseen Brownie Queen,
"unnatural? No, this, too, is Nature. You are only
reading between the
poet's lines of peaceful
beauty. You will learn
your lesson by and by."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/fig_007.jpg" width="275" height="187" alt="Fig. 7.&mdash;&quot;For a Ravenous Wasp Larva to Devour.&quot;" title="Fig. 7.&mdash;&quot;For a Ravenous Wasp Larva to Devour.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;"For a Ravenous Wasp Larva to Devour."</span>
</div>

<p>I went back to the
rustic seat beneath the
Elm, and thought. A
butterfly flew by. I
followed its flight.
"Oh! that is too bad!"
I cried involuntarily. It had struck the snare of the
Orbweaving spider. It struggled helplessly in the toils.
Swiftly the aranead sped from its pretty leafy tent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
along its trap line, and in a moment seized and began
swathing its victim. A thick ribbon of pure white silk
streamed from the spinnerets, and enwrapped the butterfly
round and round as it was revolved by the spider's
feet. It was swathed like a mummy at last, and left
lashed and hanging to the cross lines, while its captor
mounted to her nest and began leisurely to haul up the
captive preparatory to a sumptuous meal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/fig_008.jpg" width="350" height="229" alt="Fig. 8.&mdash;The Cicada Wasp, Sphecius speciosus." title="Fig. 8.&mdash;The Cicada Wasp, Sphecius speciosus." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The Cicada Wasp, Sphecius speciosus.</span>
</div>

<p>My pity had hardly time to express itself ere another
insect form swept by. It was a blue wasp, a Mud-dauber.
It flew to the Orbweaver's web. Another victim? It is
within the toils! The spider leaves her prey and darts
along the trap line. What? will she not venture? No!
she recoils. But too late! The Wasp has seized her,
plunged its sharp sting into her body, and shaking the
bits of web from its feet flies away. I know what that
means. The clay sarcophagus on yonder barn wall shall
receive another morsel of preserved meat for a ravenous
wasp larva to devour.</p>

<p>What had I to say about this incident? This; I found
myself unconsciously asking, "What will destroy the
Wasp, in its turn?" But I had no leisure to meditate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
an answer. A beautiful creature flitted past me, whose
colors of orange and black were distinct even in flight. It
was the fine, large Digger-wasp,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> the largest of that
family among our indigenous insects. Just then from the
branch of a small oak a Cicada sounded his rolling
love call. A note not very melodious to human ear,
it is true, but it throbs with the passion of affection,
and must have been sweet music to his mate on the
branch near by. Unlucky lover! your love sonnet
has sounded your doom. It shall be your death song.
See! my beautiful Wasp has pounced upon the amorous
Cicada, and pierced and paralyzed like the spider
before him, he is being borne to a grave in that grassy
bank. There, in the Wasp's burrow, buried alive though
with a semblance of death, he shall feed the maw of a
hungry worm.</p>

<p>"It is mother love!" exclaimed the unseen Brownie
Queen, sadly I thought and tenderly. "But mother
love seems cruel sometimes; and it alone has not taught
the Wasp to spare the mating love of its fellow insects."</p>

<p>This is not all that I saw, but this is such as I saw
on that memorable occasion. My experience started a
train of meditation that was the reverse of agreeable.
But what could I say? I had been observing the facts
of Nature, nothing more nor less. I looked away over
the landscape again and my feelings were not what they
were before. Underneath the surface of all this beauty
and summer repose I seemed to feel the beating of a
fevered pulse. Yes, the Doctor of the Gentiles spake
truly: "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Yes, I was beginning to read between the
lines! Verily, I perceived that the insect world in the
matter of anxiety, struggles and sufferings, in passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
of love, hate and covetousness, is after all in some sort a
miniature of our own world of human beings.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I sat pondering these things,
but I was presently conscious that my Brownie friends
had returned.</p>

<p>"You have changed your opinion about some of the
inferior creatures, have you not?" began Queen Fancy.
"I know that it must be so. And now it remains for
you to change your opinion about us. You think we are
perfectly happy, never touched by such conflicts and
cares as mortals and insects have. No! it is with us as
it is with you and all the rest. One idea runs through
all Nature and all her creatures high and low. All
alike, from gnats and fairies to mastodons and men, have
friends and foes, perils and pleasures, pains and joys,
loves and hates, bitter disappointments and proud attainments;
watchings, cares, strifes, battles, defeats, heart
desolations, sickness, oppressions, despoilment, death&mdash;all
these and the reverse of all these happen to us all."</p>

<p>"It is true!" I answered, "I see now that it is quite
true. The fact that creatures are small and unknown
to us, and outside our ordinary region of feeling and
thought, does not hinder them from having joys and
sorrows, trials and triumphs even as we have. I will
never think of Nature again, and of the insect world in
particular, without remembering this double side of its
life history."</p>

<p>"That is very good," said Queen Fancy, "and now
we wish you to remember also that Brownies are a part
of Nature and share the general rule. Our lives are so
interwoven with all natural surroundings, and with yourselves
as well, that we feel keenly everything that goes
on around us. But enough for this time. I promised
you something further about our history. Now I make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
the promise good. I am to deliver to you the records
of some of our kin which have lately fallen into our
hands. You will read them; write them out carefully,
and give them to Mr. Mayfield to edit and print.
Nobody can do that so well as he. Indeed, his name
and his stories about our Old Farm Tenants have gone
among our people on the far Ohio border; and that is
the reason why these records of the Brownies and their
wars have been sent hither to be given into his care.
There, I have done."</p>

<p>Queen Fancy clapped her hands and a herald at her
side blew upon a tiny shell, a wee miniature, for all the
world, of the conch shell which Sarah the cook blows
for dinner. Suddenly, a vast host of little folk issued
from the grass plat along the slope toward the springhouse.
They were arranged rank upon rank, whole companies
in column, and they all were drawing at ropes no
bigger than a lady's hair. Presently, I saw the round
top of a rolled parcel emerge above the summit of the
slope. It moved slowly, and I was puzzled to know
by what force it was impelled, until I saw that it was
mounted upon a toy cart which was being drawn by the
Brownie host. On the night before I had been reading
(it was a curious coincidence!) Wilkinson's account of
the Ancient Egyptians, and had been especially interested
in the manner in which their bulky architecture
had been reared, and particularly in a picture that
showed a colossal stone statue of some sovereign being
drawn upon a sled by an army of laborers. The Brownie
exploit reminded me of these old Egyptians. Here were
the little folk of our Old Farm showing mimic reproduction
of life on the Nile in the days of Abraham!
Strange!</p>

<p>The Brownie host never stopped until the parcel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
reached my feet. Then the Queen called a halt, and,
turning to me, said: "Abby, Schoolmistress, we commit
this precious roll to you. Receive it as a sacred trust; do
our will concerning it, and be forevermore the Brownies'
good friend." She clapped her hands, the herald blew
his shell bugle, and in a moment the entire host had
melted away into the foliage and were lost to sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Boy&#39;s Illustration.</span><br />
<span class="smallcaps">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;Brownies Bringing the Roll of Records.</span>
</div>

<p>I have not seen them since, but I have tried to fulfill
my part of the trust which came to me so curiously in
the drowsy hours of that June day, and now I deliver
my work to you that you in turn may fulfill your portion
of the apportioned duty. That you will not fail is
the confident hope of</p>

<p class="closesal">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sigs"><span class="smcap">Abby Bradford.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"What do you think of that?" I asked, as I finished
Abby's letter, for I had read it aloud to the Mistress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Mistress, looking up from her
embroidery, "we had better open the parcel."</p>

<p>A familiar twinkle colored her smile, that raised a
momentary suspicion that she perhaps knew something
more of the contents than she chose to tell. The advice
was good, albeit deftly dodging my question, so I cut the
wrappings and exposed a roll of fair manuscript. "It
is a story," I remarked, after glancing over the pages,
"a sort of historical fairy tale, I fancy. But, hold!
what is this?" My eye had fallen upon some sentences
that arrested attention, and I read several continuous
pages.</p>

<p>The Mistress interrupted the reading: "Well, what
has interested you? And what have you to say about
the whole affair?"</p>

<p>"I have been reading here a curious adaptation of
the habits of my spider pets, and it is neatly put. And
here is another of the same sort." I turned to a chapter
further on, and read with great satisfaction a few pages
more. "Really," I exclaimed, "the natural history is
good, and is fairly inwoven with the tale. I have
changed my opinion of the work; it is evidently an
attempt to bring out some of the most interesting habits
of our American spider fauna by personifying them
with the imaginary creatures of fairy lore. You want
to know my opinion of the matter? As to the manuscript
I shall not, of course, venture an opinion until
I have read it with some care. As to the author&mdash;well,
perhaps you can tell better than I. When did Abby
write it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mistress waited a moment or two and then in her
quiet way replied, "Pray, how should I know? Abby
is of age, ask her; she can speak for herself."</p>

<p>Thus the affair of the Brownie records rested until
I had gone over the manuscript more carefully. Then
the Mistress was again consulted.</p>

<p>"Will you print the papers?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am in doubt what to do. I think that it might
find a kindly welcome, but&mdash;I fear the verdict of the
public, especially the clientage upon whose favor its fate
most depends&mdash;the young people. Though, to be sure,
it is evidently not written wholly for them."</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion," the Mistress remarked. "Let
us take two evenings in the week and read it to our
farm people. They form a typical audience, I am sure,
and their judgment will be a fair test of the possible
verdict of the public at large."</p>

<p>"The very idea!" I cried. "You have come to my
help, my dear, with your usual practical wisdom. Let
us have the readings."</p>

<p>Behold us, then, the entire Old Farm family, with the
exception of Abby, who was absent on a visit to New
England friends, seated around the great Elm during the
long June evenings, trying the merits of the Fairies'
history. When the early tea was over, we took our seats
(or rather positions, for some of the party preferred to
recline upon the grass), around the tree, and the reading
began, and continued until twilight. Sometimes I read,
sometimes the Mistress, and in three weeks the story
was finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now for the verdict," I said. "The children first.
What say you? Shall we print the Brownie book?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Joe, "why not, Sir? I think those
wars and adventures with the Pixies are just the thing
for boys like me."</p>

<p>"I would print it," said Jennie modestly. "I think
the Brownies' love stories are pretty indeed; though I
don't like so much fighting, and the Pixies are just
horrid."</p>

<p>"Print it, Sir!" cried Harry enthusiastically. "I'm
sure boys like me will want to hear all about the Moth,
Wasp, Bee and Butterfly ponies, and the curious, wise
tricks of the Spider-pixies."</p>

<p>"As for me," said Hugh, "I'm young enough yit to
relish a fairy story uv mos' any sort. So I wote with
the youngsters to prent the book."</p>

<p>"My 'pinion hain't much good, I reckon," said Sarah,
who stood half concealed behind the Elm with her
hands upon her hips in her favorite posture. "An' I
hain't no sort uv notion uv witches an' sich, no way.
Tho' laws-a-massy! I b'lieve in 'em; 'v course I do!
But somehow, I don't feel over comfo'ble to hev sech
things a-prentin' about our Ole Farm. W'at's people
goin' to say about sech goins-on, any way? I don't
mind about the Brownies; like es not ther be sech folk.
An' w'y not here as well as other places? I don't know
w'ere they'd find a nicer home than jes' aroun' here;
an' I'm pos'tive my kitchen's trig enough fer any kind
o' fairies as ever was. Folks as hev sense enough to use
a conch shell, now, as them Brownie heralds do, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
jes' likely to settle at the Ole Farm. But es for them
Pixies&mdash;w'at's the use uv sech critters, anyhow? 'Tain't
no ways comfo'ble to think thet they mought be squattin'
on our premises. Howsomever, I'd prent the book, I
reckon. Leastways, ye kin do it, fer all me, 'f ye're a
mine ter. My notion is it's a sight more interestener
nor the Say-an-says. Though, they was worth prentin'
too, that's a fac'!"</p>

<p>"Now, Dan, it's your turn," I said; "what say you?"</p>

<p>The old colored man sat on a low stool at the outer
margin of the family circle, with his face leaning upon
his hands. He raised his head, laid his palms upon his
knees, rolled his eyes expressively and gave his verdict
with all the solemnity of a judge passing sentence on a
capital offender.</p>

<p>"'Pears to me, Mars Mayfiel' an' Misses," he began,
"dat dat's a powerful good story, an' a true one, too!
W'y, I've seed dem wery Brownies myse'f. Uv coorse
I hev!" he exclaimed emphatically, turning an indignant
glance upon Sarah, who had uttered a significant
guttural expression of unbelief. "W'at do you know
aboout Brownies, Sary Ann, I'd jes' like to know?
Pixies is more in your line, a heap sight! Down in ole
Marylan', now, dar's a power ob Brownies and Fairies

<p>"But, Dan," I said, "you haven't told us yet what

<p>"Needer I have, Sah!" the old man replied, rolling
up the whites of his eyes and shaking his shaggy, gray
poll. "Needer I have! an' wat's moah, I ain't gwine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>

Hit's mighty good hearin', I'll say dat fer it, but&mdash;" he
shook his head once more, and was silent.</p>

<p>The next day I wrote to the Schoolmistress as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigs">The Old Farm.</p>

<p class="noindent">My dear Miss Abby:</p>

<p>I have gone over the manuscript that you sent, and
on the whole I approve of it, and agree to print it with
such editorial notes as Queen Fancy has suggested. We
have also&mdash;the Mistress and I&mdash;read it to the Farm
family, having revived our last winter's "Say-an-says"
for that purpose. I have even translated bits of the
story into simpler form and speech for the youngest
member of our household, four-year-old Dorothy. Our
young people are enthusiastic in their admiration, and
vote to print the book. So do the others, with the
exception of Dan, who is noncommittal. But the old
fellow enjoyed the reading as much as the rest. He
thinks the story a true one, and declares that he has
seen the Brownies! You know his boundless superstition,
and his odd habits of personifying all living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
things and talking aloud to them as he goes about his
work. I have no doubt that he has peopled his little
world with many queer imaginary creatures who may
well stand to his undisciplined fancy for Fairies and
Goblins, Brownies and Pixies. He has unwavering
faith, also, in the occult influence of such beings and of
insects generally upon the destinies of human kind.</p>

<p>By the way, this unexpected deliverance of Dan's has
eased my mind as to one feature of the story, viz: the
manner in which the life and behavior of the Willes are
interwoven with, and interdependent upon, the movements
of the Brownies and Pixies. Since I have thought
more about it, I have greatly abated the fear that the
verisimilitude of such relations might not sufficiently
appear to readers.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the creatures of the Insect World,
as personified in the story, have had and shall have much
to do with determining the lot of man. The plagues of
Egypt as written in the Book of Exodus, furnish an
example; as also the incursions of cankerworm, locust,
caterpillar and palmerworm recorded elsewhere in Scripture.
African travelers tell us that the tetze fly
has so circumscribed the geographical bounds within
which certain domestic animals can live, as to greatly
limit or modify civilization. We all know examples of
the effects of mosquito supremacy at certain points of
our country in determining the fortunes of men or places.
The familiar stories of Bruce and the Spider, and
Mahomet and the Spider, are also in point as showing
how great interests may hinge upon the behavior of an
humble animal. Here are facts enough, surely, to justify
us in facing the public with Governor Wille and his
relations to the imaginary folk of the story.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must say that I have been greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
interested to note how admirably the habits of my spider
friends admit of personification. The so-called engineering,
ballooning, cavemaking, sailing, and other operations,
are so accurately described by those words, that the manlike
qualities, motives and passions attributed to the
actors seem almost natural. At one moment I find
myself accepting the representations as a matter of
course, and anticipating the conduct described on the
very ground of known natural habits. At another time
I am startled at the strong tone of human behavior that
the descriptions so easily admit. Certainly, this is something
more than what the naturalists have called
"anthropomorphism." What is the mysterious ligature
that binds in this sympathy of movements the sovereign
will of immortal man and the automatic brain cell of a
spider?</p>

<p>Pardon me! it was not in my purpose to start so profound
a question of philosophy and physiology. I only
meant to say that the wishes of yourself and your
Brownie acquaintances shall be cheerfully granted, and
the manuscript be given to the public.</p>

<p class="closing">I am, very truly,</p>

of this book was read, was a friend's lad, eight years old, a visitor at the
Old Farm. The Mistress noticed him during the intervals of the readings
busy with pencil and paper, amusing himself with such drawings as
children are wont to make. A number of these had been made and
thrown away ere it occurred to the good woman to call my attention
thereto. I was much surprised and delighted to find that the boy had
been engaged in illustrating the Brownie Book (as we then familiarly
called it). It was a good sign of the value of the work that it could produce
such an impression upon a child of his tender years. Moreover,
the rude figures were so apt and interesting to my own mind, that I fancied
others might be equally interested therein. "Why not print
them?" suggested the Mistress. And upon mature deliberation that is
just what I resolved to do. No one but a child could make such pictures.
Let the adult, however good an artist, try as much as he may, he could
not reproduce such drawings. Indeed the better the artist, the further
would he come from achievement. That children will take at once to
these reflections of a child's mind, appears quite probable. Moreover, to
the thinking adult they must have a special value as a psychological
study. With all our knowledge of children, it is still marvellous how
little we know of a child's mind. These little tokens of its workings
perhaps may help us to a better knowledge. At all events, a few of
these "Boy's Illustrations" have been selected for engraving, and the
editor will be disappointed if they do not give to both his adult and
youthful readers as much pleasure as they gave to himself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Editor.</span></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="chapname">HOW THE BROWNIES CAME TO HILLSIDE.</p>


<p>Not many years ago a company of Brownies lived on
the lawn at Hillside, the home of Governor Wille.
Since the Brownies are Scotch fairies, one must ask how
they came to be dwelling so far away from their native
heather upon the green hummocks of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The question takes us back to the early part of the
Nineteenth Century, and to a Manse and glebe on the
banks of Loch Achray, the beautiful little lake that lies
at the entrance to Trosachs Glen, quite near the foot of
Loch Katrine in Scotland. Here dwelt Governor Wille's
grandfather, a godly minister of the Gospel; and here
he lived until there grew up around him a large family
of sturdy lads and lasses. Often had the good minister
looked over his household as they sat around the table
eating with keen relish their cakes and oatmeal porridge,
and wondered: "How shall I provide for them all?
How shall I find fitting duty and engagement for these
eager hearts, restless hands, and busy brains?"</p>

<p>At last he answered: "I will go with them to
America, and join my brother there on the banks of the
Ohio River."</p>

<p>Now the Manse and glebe were the seat of a nation
of the wee fairyfolk whom Scotchmen call Brownies.
The Manse site is on the skirt of Ben An's lowest slope;
and across the Trosachs road, upon a point that pushes
into the Loch, stands the kirk amid its kirkyard. The
Brownies were fond of this home, but they loved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Manse folk much more dearly; and so when they heard
the plan to emigrate to the New World, they resolved
not to allow their friends to go to America without an
escort of their fairy companions and caretakers.</p>

<p>A General Assembly of all the Manse Brownies was
therefore called, to meet under the "hats" of a clump
of broad toadstools growing on the mountain slope, close
by the barn. The place was crowded from the stem of
the central toadstool to the rim of the outer hat. Outside
this clump the spears of grass, the drooping bluebells,
and purple blossoms of heather were covered with
boy Brownies, who climbed up delicate stems, smooth
blades and gnarled stalks, much as city lads mount lampposts,
trees and awnings to gaze upon a procession.
From these points they looked upon their elders, quite
as anxious and earnest, if not as well informed as they.</p>

<p>When the Assembly had been called to order, the
King of the Brownies asked, "Who will volunteer to
go to America with our dear friends, the Willes?"</p>

<p>There was a mighty shout; not one present failed to
answer: "I!!"</p>

<p>The explosion fairly shook the roof of their toadstool
tabernacle. Thereat the old monarch sprang to his feet,
removed his plumed hat, and stood uncovered, bowing
his white hairs and venerable beard before the Assembly,
in honor of their noble response. The elders waved
their tiny blue Scotch bonnets, wept, laughed and
hallooed in turn. The youngsters danced upon the
heather bells and swung from the grass blades until the
tops swayed to and fro, and cheered again and again for
the Willes, for the King, for the Brownies, for everybody!</p>

<p>By and by the King brought the Assembly to order,
and proposed that a colony be drafted from the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
company to go to the New World. "I shall claim the
privilege of naming the leader of the Expedition," said
he, "and I name Murray Bruce. The rest may go
by lot."</p>

<p>Whereat the Brownies cheered again, for they were
always pleased to respect their good sovereign's wishes,
and Bruce was one of the wisest, steadiest, and bravest
of their number. He was tall, strong, comely, and in
the prime of his years. Then the lot was cast. The
names of all the active Brownies were placed in the tiny
corol of a blue bell, which served as a voting urn. The
King drew out fifty names, and these were the elect
members of the colony. The interest was intense as the
drawing went on. Again and again the King's hand
sank into the urn, and came out holding the wee billet
that decided some Brownie's destiny. As the name was
announced, there was silence; but thereupon a flutter of
excitement ran through the company; a whirl of noisy
demonstration marked the spot where the fortunate nominee
was receiving the congratulations of his friends;
sometimes a cheer was given when a favorite or familiar
name was announced.</p>

<p>"How many names have been drawn?" asked the
King.</p>

<p>"Forty-nine," answered the Lord Keeper. Amid
profound silence the last name was drawn and announced:</p>

<p>"Rodney Bruce!"</p>

<p>It was the Captain's brother, a young and promising
sailor, who had won much praise for daring adventures
with water pixies on "the stream that joins Loch Katrine
and Achray." His name was welcomed with
cheers, and then a buzz of disappointment arose from
the crowd who heartily envied the "Fortunate Fifty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
However, the disappointment soon passed away, for
Brownies are a cheerful and contented folk. The hum
of voices ceased, and the people waited to know what
might be needed to forward the comfort and success of
the emigrant escort.</p>

<p>"How shall we get off?" said Captain Bruce. "Has
your Majesty any orders or counsel? Has the Assembly
any advice?"</p>

<p>That was a puzzling question. The Lord Keeper,
Lord Herald, and all the other lords and nobles shook
their heads wisely and said nothing. Some one called
out the name of "Rodney, the sailor," whereat the old
Lord Admiral turned up his little red nose, looked contemptuously
at the speaker, and muttered something
about "land lubbers." As no one had any advice to
venture, all waited for their sovereign's opinion.</p>

<p>"Hoot!" said the King at last, "Ye shall juist gae
your ain gait. Howiver, ye maun steal awa' unbeknowns,
I'se warrant ye; for Parson Wille, good heart!
will never allow ye to risk anything for him. But
how? Well, I dinna ken; ye maun e'en settle that,
amang yoursels."</p>

<p>The difficulty was no nearer solution than before.
There was another long pause. It was broken by a
voice that called from the outer edge of the Assembly.</p>

<p>"I can tell you how!" It was Walter MacWhirlie
who spoke, one of the chosen escort.</p>

<p>"Come to the front, then," said the King, "and say
your say."</p>

<p>Every eye was at once fixed on the bold speaker.
But MacWhirlie, nothing abashed, leaped from the
heather stalk on which he stood, and making a double
somersault above the whole company, landed erect upon
the edge of a leaf whereon sat the King and lords.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh!" said the monarch, starting back; for MacWhirlie
had well nigh alighted on his toes.</p>

<p>"Queak!" cried the Queen; and "queak, queak!"
screamed the Princesses, tumbling over one another in
their fright.</p>

<p>"You rude beast!" growled the Lord Keeper, laying
his hand upon his broadsword.</p>

<p>But the youth and boys cheered, the young Princesses
began to giggle, the old folks laughed outright,
the Queen smoothed down her ruffles, the good King
composed his countenance and smiled, and the Lord
Keeper smothered his indignation and put up his sword.</p>

<p>"Speak up, laddie," said the King. MacWhirlie
bowed low first to the royal party, and then to the lords.
(My Lord Keeper's brow cleared up somewhat at that.)</p>

<p>"I was passin' thro' the barn the morn," he began,
"and saw the gardener packin' the auld kist that lies on
the barn floor, with tools, seeds, roots and herbs. It's a
gude place for hidin', is yon kist."</p>

<p>"That it is," exclaimed the Queen laughing, "I've
had mony a game o' bo-peep in 't mysel'."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, so it is!" was the hearty assent from all
parts of the hall, while the lads on the outside signified
their approval by cheers for the old chest.</p>

<p>"A gude place for hidin' is yon auld kist," continued
MacWhirlie. "I ken naethin' like it for Brownies. An'
if your Majesty please, we can a' ride to America safe
eneugh in that."</p>

<p>"It is gude counsel," cried the King, clapping his
hands. "Forbye, I would na thoct it frae sic a giddy
pate as yoursel', MacWhirlie. Many thanks, however,
and mak' ready quarters in the auld kist for your
journey to the New World. Herald, dismiss the Assembly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Herald skipped to the front and sounded a
bugle, which in sooth was nothing more than a tiny
shell fitted with a dainty mouthpiece.</p>

<p>"Hi-e-iero! ee-roo!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_012.jpg" width="400" height="448" alt="Fig. 12.&mdash;The Old Chest on its Journey Across the Allegheny Mountains." title="Fig. 12.&mdash;The Old Chest on its Journey Across the Allegheny Mountains." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;The Old Chest on its Journey Across the Allegheny Mountains.</span>
</div>

<p>Then he struck his staff thrice, and cried, or rather
intoned in a loud voice these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O-eez; O-eez; O-eez!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bide by the King's decrees!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brownies-O-bonnie, and Brownies-O-braw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither gae, hame gae, Brownies awa'!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the last word the Assembly arose, and speaking all
together, responded,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Brownies aye, Brownies a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leal and true, awa', awa'!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they separated, the elders moving soberly, the
youth scampering off hither and thither, leaping, chattering,
cheering, making the grass blades twinkle with their
good natured frolic. In a moment the toadstools were
deserted, and a great spider-pixie crept under the
vacant central hat, and began to shake his head and
talk to himself while uttering a low, harsh, chuckling
laugh.</p>

<p>Bruce, Rodney, MacWhirlie and all the elect escort,
together with their families, made the voyage across the
Atlantic safely though somewhat uncomfortably. But
their trials were not over when they landed in Philadelphia.
The chest was hoisted into a big road wagon
covered with canvas, known as a "Conestoga wagon," and
wheeled on for many days over the Allegheny mountains.
Down by old Fort Pitt it trundled, along the
banks of the beautiful river Ohio, to the frontier village
of Steubenville. There the wagon stopped. Parson
Wille built his cabin on Hillside. The Brownies, happy
as the beasts and birds that were turned out of Noah's
Ark after the flood, were released from their prison in
the old chest, and took up once more old duties and
pleasures in the clearings, cornfields and garden of the
new home.</p>

<p>That was many years ago. The good parson has long
since been received to a fairer Home than either Scotland
or America ever gave; but his grandson, Governor
Wille, lives at Hillside. It is not the same Hillside
that the brave and godly minister first built his log cabin
upon, you may be sure. Great changes have occurred.
But the same Brownies are there; as good natured, as
frolicsome, as fond of their friends and as true to them
as ever, yet, we are sorry to say, not so fortunate and
happy. What has troubled them?</p>

<p class="chapname">SPITE THE SPY.</p>


<p>When the Assembly of Brownies, which had been
held at the old Scotch Manse, was quite dispersed, a
spider-pixie entered the vacant tent and began to spin a
web. He belonged to a race of sprites as vicious and
cruel as the Brownies are kind and good. They are
called spider-pixies because they do much of their mischief
by means of silken webs or snares which they spin,
and in which they catch their enemies. The fact, however,
should work no prejudice against those remarkable
creatures, the spiders, which are doubtless worthy of all
the loving attention that naturalists give them.</p>

<p>The chief enemies of these Pixies (next to themselves,
to be sure) were the Brownies. Not that the good little
fairies wished to harm any creature; but then, as the
Pixies wished harm to every one, and were always showing
their ill will by naughty tricks, the Brownies, out
of very goodness, tried to thwart their evil plans and
save intended victims from harm. Thus it came that
the Brownies and Pixies lived in continuous warfare.
Many a battle had they fought on and around the Manse
glebe and kirkyard, for the Pixies hated Parson Wille
most cordially, and dearly loved to annoy him.</p>

<p>The Brownies were just as hearty in their love, and
by close watching, hard working and brave battling
they had well nigh driven their enemies from the
place. Only once in a while a few, more daring and
cunning than the rest, would break through the boundaries
and make a foray upon the forbidden grounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the most successful of these leaders of mischief
was Spite the Spy. He was a great sneak, shrewd and
sly, and well deserved his name. He was a coward in
the main, and loved best to do his mischief in an underhand
way. But for all that, he was so full of malice
that he could be quite venturesome rather than miss a
chance to work harm to those whom he hated. Thus it
came that in spite of his natural cowardice he had a fair
reputation for boldness. It was this miserable fellow
who crawled into the tabernacle as the voices of the
Brownies died away among the grasses.</p>

<p>How came he therein? Having chanced to hear of
the proposed Assembly to consider the interest of the
Manse folk, he set himself to spy out the proceedings.
How should he do that without being discovered? "Let
me think!" he said. He climbed up a tall weed that
grew on the border of the Manse farm, swung himself
by a thread of silk from a leaf, and hung there awhile,
head downward, while he meditated.</p>

<p>"Ha! I have it!" he cried. He pulled himself up
again hand over hand, scampered down the weed and
plunged into the thick forest of grasses. He went swiftly,
though cautiously, for a while. Then he ascended a tall
spear of timothy, perched himself atop of the bearded
head and reconnoitered.</p>

<p>"Yes, there it is," he said to himself. "I see the
brown hat of the toadstool tent; and&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes,
sure enough, there is the Black Pebble under which
cousin Atypus used to have her nest. Any Brownies
about? No, the coast's quite clear. But, caution, old
fellow! you are pretty sly, but you may be caught after
all. And they'd make short work of Spite if they got
hold of him once, I warrant." At this he chuckled,
puffed out his eyes, and swelled up his round pouch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
though it were a fine thing to be quite deserving of the
Brownies' anger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_013.jpg" width="400" height="414" alt="Fig. 13.&mdash;&quot;Silken Snares in Which They Catch Their Enemies.&quot;" title="Fig. 13.&mdash;&quot;Silken Snares in Which They Catch Their Enemies.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;"Silken Snares in Which They Catch Their Enemies."</span>
</div>

<p>Spite was not long in making his way to the Black
Pebble which was at the outer edge of the Brownies'
meeting place, and was imbedded in a little bank of
sandy earth at the base of which the toadstools grew.
He began to scratch in the surrounding soil. His claws
soon struck something that gave him pleasure. It was a
bit of silken tissue.</p>

<p>"Ha! I am in luck! Here is the door of the burrow.
Now we shall see, brother Brownies, and hear too; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
if there's any mischief agoing Spite the Spy will have
his spinner in it."</p>

<p>Spite had come upon the door of a cave or tunnel.
When a few more grains of sand had been thrown aside
he lifted the tissue door and entered. It was dark at
first, and there was a musty smell in the air. Spite did
not care for that, and in a moment ran to the far end of
the cave and back again. This strange place had once
been the home of a Burrow Pixie. It was a tunnel
scooped out of the sandy earth.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> It ran horizontally
for a short way, and then sloped downward. It was
lined around the sides, top and bottom with a tight
silken tube, and was about half an inch in diameter. It
was, therefore, a tunnel within a tunnel, a silk within a
sand one. The silk supported the sides so completely
that not a particle of soil could pass through. The
upper part of the tube projected from the earth, falling
forward so as to form a flap which protected the mouth
of the burrow or cave. At first the tube had been much
longer and was bent and carried over the surface among
the moss. This was the door which Spite had been
looking for, and whose discovery so much pleased him.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Spite, talking all the while to himself,
"this is lucky indeed. It must now be several
moons since cousin Atypus was cut off by the Brownies,
and here is her old place just as good as ever. It looks
right into the meeting house. How fortunate! But I
must fix up this door a little, or I shall have those suspicious
fellows smelling around here; although I doubt
whether they know anything about the place. They
caught Atypus when she had ventured out of doors."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<img src="images/fig_014.jpg" width="307" height="500" alt="Fig. 14.&mdash;English Atypus in Her Burrow." title="Fig. 14.&mdash;English Atypus in Her Burrow." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;English Atypus in Her Burrow.</span>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Spite was busy with the door. He laid a
dry leaf and a few bits of dry moss around the edge of
the pebble, then gently lifted the silken flap and crept
within. He made a wee hole in the flap, and through
this saw and heard the proceedings of the Brownies.
Little did the good folk suspect that one of their
enemies was so near, almost in their midst. As for
Spite, he was in high glee, although he was not without
fears. The boy Brownies had climbed atop the Black
Pebble, and crowded and capered upon it until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
were like to shake it from the bank, and send it arolling
into the Assembly.</p>

<p>"Serve 'em right, the little plagues," snarled Spite,
"if the old rock did get loose, and break all their necks
in the avalanche. Only, that would make a gap in my
burrow, and&mdash;well, it isn't pleasant to think of the consequences."</p>

<p>Moreover, MacWhirlie and the restless youngsters who
were mounted on the herbage that grew above and
around the Pixie's cave, were continually tramping over
the moss around the door, rocking to and fro on the
overhanging heather sprays till the roots fairly shook,
and scrambling up and down the little slope and over
the flap itself. No wonder that Spite's heart seemed to
jump into his throat occasionally.</p>

<p>However, the door of the cave was so cunningly disguised
and fitted into the bank, that Spite was not
discovered. He was well satisfied, for all that, when the
meeting was dismissed and the last of the Brownies
disappeared. He pushed open the flap, peeped out,
then crawled slowly into the light, crept down the slope
and entered the vacant meeting place. He was hungry;
the labors and excitement through which he had passed
had quite exhausted him. He therefore crouched
behind a toadstool stem, and, after waiting patiently
a while, sprang upon and devoured a hapless fly and
beetle that chanced to straggle that way. Then he
wiped his jaws with his hairy claw, rubbed his cheeks
and head quite in the fashion of pussy washing her face,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
stretched a few silken threads from the stem to the
ground, and turned away.</p>

<p>"There," he said, "I leave those few lines to show
that I have been here, and that Spite the Spy is sharper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
than all the Brownies. Now for home! King Cobweb
will be interested in what I have to tell. As for Parson
Wille and his Brownies, perhaps they shall not escape
us quite so readily."</p>

<p>Spite gained great applause by this adventure, and
when it was resolved to send out to the New World some
one to watch the motions of Parson Wille, and do all
the harm possible to his kind Brownie guardians, who
but Spite the Spy should be chosen? "You need take
but few companions," said King Cobweb; "there are
plenty of our folk in that country. I shall send a letter
with you to my cousin, King Cobweaver, and you can
muster a goodly company in America."</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_15" id="Fig_15"></a>
<img src="images/fig_015.jpg" width="400" height="188" alt="Fig. 15.&mdash;&quot;Having Overspun Themselves.&quot;" title="Fig. 15.&mdash;&quot;Having Overspun Themselves.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 15.&mdash;"Having Overspun Themselves."</span>
</div>

<p>Now what should Spite do, but make his way straight
to the old chest. He discovered that in one corner the
joints of the planks had sprung open a little. "That
will do bravely, I think!" He crept into the crack to
try if it fitted his size.</p>

<p>"Very good indeed," he exclaimed, and then ran to
report.</p>

<p>King Cobweb was quite satisfied. Spite thereupon hid
himself in the open seam with two other Pixies named
Hide and Heady, and, having overspun themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a silken covering, made the voyage to America in the
old chest with the Brownies.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>When safely landed at Hillside, he reported to the
nearest tribe of Pixies. He was received with great
favor as a distinguished foreigner; was feasted, petted,
and his wonderful skill in strategy heralded everywhere.
In short, he was quite a lion, and his fame was even
greater in America than on the other side of the Atlantic.
Spite took his honors gracefully, enjoyed them hugely,
acknowledged them publicly, hobnobbed with his friends,
and took occasion when talking in private with his two
countrymen, to ridicule the customs and manners of
American Pixies. That was very mean, to be sure; but
what better could you expect from Spite the Spy?</p>

<p>In the midst of all his junketings and sight-seeing
Spite never once forgot the great object of his journey.
He was spinning out his plots against the Brownies,
counseling with his American friends how he might
worry, injure and destroy them, and forming leagues
for that purpose.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of troubles for the Brownies
at Hillside.</p>

<p class="chapname">ADVENTURES OF THE BROWNIE SCOUTS.</p>


<p>The war upon the Brownie colony thus begun by
Spite the Spy had been waged from year to year until
the third generation of the Willes, Governor Wille
himself, occupied Hillside. Sometimes the Pixies got
the advantage, sometimes the Brownies; but on the
whole the Pixies gained ground. Slowly the Brownies
were being driven in towards the Mansion house, followed
closely by their foes. At last the malicious persecutors,
led by Spite, pitched their tents and reared
a strong fortification at the upper end of the Lawn.
Their scouts bivouacked beneath the very windows of
my Lady Governor's chamber. This would never have
been had not Governor Wille lately grown heedless of
his good fairy friends, and left them to struggle without
his sympathy and aid. For Home Brownies lose
heart and cease to prosper when their Home patrons and
allies forget and neglect them. The Brownies were sore
distressed. What should they do?</p>

<p>Early one morning the Captain and Lieutenant were
in close consultation. The Brownies watched them
anxiously as the two slowly walked back and forth
underneath a rose bush in a border near the west
window of the parlor. The point under discussion was
this: "Shall we make another appeal to Governor Wille,
or shall we first try an assault upon the new Pixie
fort?"</p>

<p>The decision was soon announced by the bugle call to
"fall in." From every quarter the Brownies crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
eagerly, and the column moved toward the northwestern
corner of the Lawn. There lay a pool formed
by a stream that bubbled from beneath the springhouse
at the foot of the hill. The Brownies called the pool
"Loch Katrine," in honor of the lovely and historic
water in their old Scotch home from whose neighborhood
they had come. Just beyond the "outlet," the point at
which the Spring Run issues from the pool and goes
singing down the hillside, the new Pixie fort had been
erected. It was called Fort Spinder, and was
a sign and token that Spite and his tribes had gained and
meant to keep a foothold upon the Lawn, the Brownies'
special domain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig_016.jpg" width="500" height="290" alt="Fig. 16.&mdash;The Demilune, or Crescent Barricade." title="Fig. 16.&mdash;The Demilune, or Crescent Barricade." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;The Demilune, or Crescent Barricade.</span>
</div>

<p>In a brief space the Brownie army had surrounded
three sides of the fort; the fourth side faced the Lake,
and was safe from approach of land troops. Then
Captain Bruce sent out a number of scouts to view the
Pixie works and report upon their strength and the best
points for attack. Let us join the Captain and his
staff, and listen to these scouts as one after another
they return with their reports. We shall thus learn
something of the Pixies' deft handicraft and cunning
ways.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;"><a name="Fig_17" id="Fig_17"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"The first obstacle that I met," said Sightwell, who
was the first scout to report, "was a line of barricades
occupied by the Wheel Legion. This is formed of
round webs woven upon grass and weeds, closely joined
to one another and strung in a semicircular form along
the whole front of the fort. Armed pickets are stationed
at the open centrals of the snares. At either end of
this crescent or demilune is a large orbweb, surmounted
by a tower. One tower is wrought out of leaves lashed
together by silken threads; the other is the bell shaped
turret of Pixie Globosa.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;Fort Spinder.</span>
</div>

<p>"The centre of the demilune is occupied by a company
of the Tubeweaver Legion. They have built a
broad, irregular pavilion above and around the surface
foliage, whose margin is lashed by strong cords to
grass stalks and other herbage. Near the middle is a
long tubular entrance which opens out upon the top."<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p><p>"Did you venture into it?" asked the Captain.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 19.&mdash;Fort Spinder as the Boy saw it.</span>
</div>

<p>"No! I climbed a tall weed to reconnoitre, and from
the summit noticed that Pixies, whom I had seen to pass
underneath the canvas, appeared again through a round
hole in the roof and thence passed down into the camp.
Then I descended, cautiously made my way through the
grass, and came near enough to see the opening into the
tube, which is really the southern or front gate to the
encampment. It is set close to the ground and is well
concealed. It is guarded on each side by a sentinel.
From my weed-top observatory I could see that beyond
the demilune, and between it and the fort, the main
camp of the Pixies is pitched. The space is well covered
with tents, and everything inside seems to be settled
into homelike and comfortable condition."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Bruce with an impatient gesture.
"The wretches evidently intend to stay&mdash;if they
can. But what else did you observe?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing important. I thought best to return with
this news, while Glideaway, who went with me on the
scout, went around the demilune to observe the front of
Fort Spinder. He ought to be back ere long."</p>

<p>True to his friend's prediction, Glideaway soon appeared,
slipped quietly into the circle of officers, touched
his Scotch bonnet and awaited leave to report.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bruce, "what have you to tell?"</p>

<p>"When I left Sightwell," the scout replied, "I hurried
around the west side of the demilune, which bends
in pretty close to the fort, and ends in a tall, silk-lined
leaf-tower. This is used by sentinels as a sort of guard
house, but I managed to slip by unobserved. I got into
the Pixie camp and moved about unnoticed, passed along
the whole front of the fort and came out on the east
side. The walls of the fort are under charge of the
Lineweaving Legion, who built them. They consist of
single silken cables, crossed, knotted and interlaced
into a mass several inches thick. The cables are interwoven
with and lashed to the blades of grass and
sprigs and foliage of meadow weeds, forming a strong
wall."</p>

<p>"Could our troops break through or climb over it?"<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>Glideaway shook his head doubtingly. "It would be
a difficult task. Engineer Theridion directed the construction
and his work is thorough. However, it might
be done, and I for one am ready to try, Sir."</p>

<p>"And I, and I!" cried in chorus the officers and men
who stood around.</p>

<p>"Thanks, my brave fellows," said Bruce, his eyes
kindling with pride. "We shall doubtless have a chance
to try your mettle before long. What are the defences
of the front walls?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>"In the centre of the wall is a gate built by Engineer
Linyphia of the Lineweavers. It is a high dome hung
amidst a maze of crossed lines and protected beneath by
a curtain floor, which is swung from the dome. The
dome is pierced for defence and observation, and a strong
guard mans the curtain. The main entrance to the fort
is here, and all who go in must pass underneath it, and
through the guard.</p>

<p>"At each corner or angle of the fort is a gate like the
central one, except that the dome is reversed and becomes
a bowl. On the flanks or sides the fort is built and
manned by Lineweavers and is precisely like the front."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Captain Bruce dismissing the
scout. "Who will report as to the river front and
interior?"</p>

<p>"We detailed our most skillful men for that service,"
Adjutant Blythe answered. "Sergeants Clearview and
True have charge of the scout. It is a nice and dangerous
service, and we can't expect an early return."</p>

<p>"Let us away, then, to put our command in the best
condition possible; and when the report comes in I will
summon you."</p>

<p>The morning had quite worn away when the news
came that the scouts had returned. The officers speedily
gathered at headquarters, where Sergeant True and
three of his men were waiting. Where could the others be?
Were they lost?</p>

<p>"We skirted the eastern face of the fort," began Sergeant
True, "and reached Lake Katrine. Then we saw
that the fort is built some distance from the water on the
crown of the hill that forms the shore, which there
slopes down to the lake. The defences on the water
front are like those on the other side, but not so heavy.
The tower at the angle is different, however. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
been built by the Wolf Legion, and Captain Arenicola
is in command. It is a pentagon or five-sided turret of
dry twigs, like a log chimney, and is silk-lined within.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
The Pixies' skull-and-bones flag floats from the top.</p>

<p>"Here we held a consultation and agreed to divide
our party. Sergeant Clearview with Corporal Dare and
three men undertook to survey the river front. It fell
to myself to explore the interior of the fort, aided by
Corporal Swiftsure and two men, Lookclose and Treadlight.
Having bidden good-bye to our companions, I
explained to my men the delicate and dangerous work
in which we were engaged. Then we divided our squad
into two parties. I took Treadlight and pushed forward,
having bidden Swiftsure and Lookclose to follow
at a distance that would leave us just in view. In
case of discovery or accident to either party, the first
duty of the other was to escape and tell at headquarters
the facts already learned.</p>

<p>"The fort is so newly built that the surface is not yet
thickly covered with snares, traps and crosslines. This
greatly favored us. We found the chief part of the
fort to be an immense Tubeweaver's tent built by Engineer
Agalena. The central tube runs downward toward
the Lake, and opens out near a tower that guards the
water front. The tent is built around tall weeds which
stick out like the poles of a circus pavilion, and from
their tips strong guy lines stretch to various points on
the roof, thus bracing it up.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>"We skirted the vast edifice as far as the central
front gate, just opposite to which we found another of
Arenicola's turrets. From this point, sweeping around
toward the Lake, and fronting the tower on the southwest
angle, is erected a strong tent of the Tegenaria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
type. It is composed of a thick sheet like that of Agalena,
but this is drawn up at the margin, making a sort
of breastwork. Along the pouch-like depression within
are many sentinels for whom openings are pierced in the
breastwork. The system ends in a tall round tower, in
which Captain Tegenaria has his observatory.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>"We wished to cross the path between the front Linyphia
gate and the opposite tower, but it was so thronged
by passing Pixies that we
dare not venture. We
therefore turned back,
thinking we had discovered
enough, and ought
not to further risk losing
what we had learned."</p>

<p>"A wise and patriotic
decision," said Captain
Bruce, "but how did you
get out of the Pixie quarters?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/fig_020.jpg" width="226" height="300" alt="Fig. 20.&mdash;Arenicolas&#39; Tower and

Stridulans&#39; Drum." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Arenicolas' Tower and
Stridulans' Drum.</span>
</div>

<p>"It was not so easy to
get out of their den as to
get into it," said Sergeant
True, "as is usual when
dealing with Pixies. We had scarcely taken the back
track when a terrible racket sounded from the tower behind
us. Now we saw that a big drum hung from the top
of the turret, upon which a gigantic Pixie was beating
furiously. We knew that this must be Drummer Stridulans
whose beating sounds the various signals of the
Pixies. He was now sounding an alarm, which stirred
the fort with great excitement. Sentinels sprang to
their posts: warriors poured out of their quarters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ran to the ramparts. Soon companies were seen hurrying
toward the lake front, and amid all the rush and clatter
Stridulans' drum kept up its dolorous booming from
the turret.</p>

<p>"A score of times we barely escaped detection by the
Pixies who were running to and fro; and we lay in our
ambush almost breathless, nearly hopeless of keeping
concealed, and ready to sell our lives at the greatest
cost to our foes. Then we saw an officer run up and
signal the tower. The drum ceased, and squads of Pixies
began to return from the lake front in a quieter mood.</p>

<p>"We were anxious to know the cause of the alarm,
and of its conclusion too, for we feared it might concern
Clearview and his party. Words dropped by passing
warriors confirmed our suspicions; but of the result,
whether good or ill to our companions, we could gather
nothing. When the fort had settled into quiet we continued
our retreat; and here we are, Sir. But, it was
trying work and a close shave. We crawled through
the grass like snakes the whole way, until we had gone
around the outer wall and were fairly out of sight of
pickets and lookouts."</p>

<p>Sergeant True's report caused great uneasiness in the
Brownie camp as to the fate of the river scouting party.
At last an unusual stir around headquarters showed that
something important was afoot. An anxious crowd
gathered before the tent door, peering inside, where Sergeant
Clearview could be seen in the midst of a circle
of officers. He looked sadly draggled and worn; his
face was bruised, his clothes limp and stained, and alas,
he was alone! Let us hear his story.</p>

<p>"When we parted from Sergeant True we slowly
moved along the edge of the Lake keeping under shelter
of the sloping bank, and screening ourselves behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
tall grass at the water's brink. We passed nearly one-half
the lake front of the fort, which we found protected
in the same manner as the other sides, except
that the works are not so heavy. The Pixies clearly
intend the navy to defend that quarter from assault.
However, no ships are anchored in the stream. Indeed
we did not even meet a boat of any sort until we came
to the remains of the Old Bridge that stood, as you
remember, nearly opposite the centre of the fort, where
the water gate is placed. There we came upon a skiff
moored among the rushes.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Boy's Illustration.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 21.&mdash;The Pixie Waterman's Skiff.</span>
</div>

<p>"'Here now is our chance,' whispered Corporal Dare.
'Let us seize this boat, and we can safely pull along the
whole lake front.'</p>

<p>"I agreed to this, as there were no Pixies in sight on
shore. 'However, we must take no risks,' I said; 'there
may be a waterman hidden or asleep in the bottom of
the boat. We must approach quietly, and from all
points so as to cut off escape to the shore.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"We crept through the reeds, and at a signal rushed
together upon the skiff. Three Pixies, huge fierce fellows,
sprang from the bottom of the boat and began a vigorous
defence. One of our men was cut down instantly,
but the rest of us clambered over the gunwale and made
a hand to hand fight with our foes. The conflict was
severe; we were nearly evenly divided as to numbers,
although the Pixies had much the advantage as to size.
However, we killed two of our enemies, but could not
prevent the third from escaping. He leaped into the
lake and ran fleetly over the water. We lost sight of
him behind a clump of weeds, but knew that he would
at once give the alarm.</p>

<p>"'Come, my men, be quick!' I cried. 'Take the
oars; there is only one chance for us; we must push
into the stream and pull for life.'</p>

<p>"The order was obeyed; we were soon beyond the
rushes in clear water, and having pushed the boat into
the current, put her bow down stream, and bent to the
oars with all our might. For a few moments we thought
we should pass the fort unobserved. Then we saw
several Pixies running out of the gates toward the shore;
others joined them; the boom of an alarm drum somewhere
within the fort floated over the water, and in a
brief space the shore was lined with angry troops. We
could see Spite the Spy directing affairs; and soon a
large boat shot out from the banks full of armed Pixies.</p>

<p>"'Out to sea,' I cried, 'Out!&mdash;and pull as you never
did before. Our lives depend on it.' It was vain. The
boat gained rapidly upon us, and soon nearly touched
our gunwale.</p>

<p>"'Cease rowing, lads,' I cried. 'There's nothing
left but to sell our lives as dearly as possible.' Corporal
Dare seized a boat hook and plunged it into a Pixie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
officer who was about to board us. But another took
his place, and another, when he too had fallen.</p>

<p>"Taught caution by these losses, our assailants drew
back from us, and while Dare stood on guard, Dart and
Dodge, the two other surviving Brownies, and myself
again took the oars. We reached the swiftest part of
the stream where the current sets in heavily toward the
shore, and I saw that we must drift in upon the beach.
This also the Pixies saw, and seemed content to keep
near us, without taking further risk. The crowd on
shore followed along our course waiting for the final act.
We were very near, but tugged away, hoping against
hope that we might be carried past the jutting point and
escape. Perhaps some such thought struck the Pixie
boat commander, or it may be his crew could not restrain
their fury. Several of them leaped out of the
boat and ran toward us upon the water. Some water-pixies
joined them from the shore. Our boat was seized.
We dropped oars, and a death struggle began. Dart,
after a gallant fight, fell dead in the boat. Dodge was
overpowered, captured and bound. Corporal Dare was
at last dragged into the water by two sailors with whom
he was in a hand to hand conflict and the three sank
together.</p>

<p>"I was alone. Wounded, nearly exhausted, overpowered
by numbers, what could I do? It was folly to
fight the whole Pixie force. Plunging my sword into
the face of the boat captain, I threw myself backward
into the Lake as though wounded unto death. Amid the
horrible clangor and applause of the Pixies' victory cry
I sank. I struck out beneath the water, swam as far as
I could, and cautiously came up to the surface. As
good fortune would have it, I arose almost within reach
of a floating leaf. This I grasped, edged myself around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to the open water side, and drifted. I saw that the two
boats were being pulled ashore by the excited captors,
who were holding aloft on the points of their spears the
body of poor Dart. There was great rejoicing, of
course, and then the crowd slowly dispersed, bearing
with them their prisoner, Dodge, and doubtless thinking
that the rest of the Brownie party had been slain.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I drifted on, and in spite of every effort
to the contrary, drew nearer the bank. The Pixie guard
had now been doubled, and I feared that I had escaped
death only to fall upon it in another form. The leaf
lodged, and unluckily upon a bare, sandy point. There
was not a blade of grass behind which to find shelter.
I therefore clung to my rude raft, which swayed up and
down, and turned round and round so that I had hard
work to keep my hold. Still, treading water, I followed
with the leaf until it reached a spot where some
driftwood had lodged.</p>

<p>"'This is my chance!' I thought.</p>

<p>"I crawled up on the sand and lay down behind and
beneath the flotsam. The warmth of the sun was pleasant,
for I was chilled by the water, and was so exhausted
that, would you believe it? I fell asleep! But my nap
was a brief one. It was broken by the sound of voices,
and starting up in a daze, I attracted the attention of
the Pixie guard boat crew engaged in patrolling the
Lake. They turned the boat to the shore, with a hurrah,
and several leaped overboard and dashed toward me
upon the water.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;"><a name="Fig_22" id="Fig_22"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 22.&mdash;Sergeant Clearview Takes Refuge in Argiope's Nest.</span>
</div>

<p>"There was nothing for it but to run, and that I did;
over the level, sandy bank, on, on&mdash;toward the tall grass
beyond. The boat's crew were soon on my track; the
shore sentinels joined them, and away we all sped pell-mell.
Affairs seemed blue enough, it is true; but I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
already escaped so wonderfully that I had high hope
that I should yet reach camp and tell my story. At last&mdash;it
seemed an age!&mdash;the grass was reached. I plunged
into the thicket, but the Pixies were close at my heels,
too close to admit of escape, for they were all fresh and
I quite worn out. As I passed a tall clump of grasses,
I caught sight of a great pear shaped egg-nest of the
huge Argiope Pixie. I knew it well, for it was an
abandoned nest of the past autumn, built there during
one of the successful raids of our enemy. A happy
thought came to me. I rushed into the grasses beyond
the nest, then turned, and doubled sharply upon my
track, ran back, sprang into the clump of grass and
weeds upon which the nest hangs, and swung myself
toward it. There is an opening in the side, a sort of door
or window for the escape of the young. Into this I
dropped, and lodged safely upon the flossy paddock
inside. I had barely got in when my pursuers dashed
by at full speed into the jungle which they had seen me
enter. The whir and clatter of their rush I could hear,
as many of the crew passed just beneath me. On they
sped; the noise grew faint, fainter, and died away. Then
I knew that once more I was saved. The bed upon
which I lay was a soft one; it was made, in fact, of
purple and yellow silk; but I was not much inclined to
sleep, you may be sure. I lay close, however, until I
heard the sound of returning footsteps. Back the Pixies
came in singles, pairs, triplets, squads; and by their
manner and utterance I learned their disappointment
and rage.</p>

<p>"At last the place was quiet, and I ventured to look
out of my little window. No enemy was in sight. I
crept forth, descended, and crawling on hands and knees,
after many adventures which I need not mention, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the front of the fort, entered the space beyond, and
easily found our camp. This is my report, Sir. It is a
sad enough one, but such are the risks of scouts; and I
can truly say for my brave comrades and myself that
we did all that we could."<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>

<p>"No one will doubt that," said Captain Bruce. "We
deeply mourn the loss of so many brave and good comrades.
May their memory be green forever!" He
withdrew his hat, and bowed his head. All present did
the same, and stood in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"We all must bear the chances of life and war," resumed
the Captain, "and now let us take up the next
duty. What shall be our policy? We have heard the
reports of the scouts; shall we make an attack?"</p>

<p>The council of war thus invoked, long and earnestly
considered the question. Had not their hearts and hands
been burdened and stayed by Governor Wille's neglect,
the Brownies would have joyfully ventured an assault
even upon such a stronghold. As matters stood, however,
they judged that an attempt would only lead to
useless loss and further discouragement. They recommended
that the siege of the fort be continued as
closely as possible, and that meanwhile Captain Bruce
and Lieutenant MacWhirlie make another appeal to
Governor Wille. Thus the council closed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="chapname">THE BROWNIES VISIT GOVERNOR WILLE.</p>


<p>All that their unaided powers could do the Brownies
had now done. But the higher Decrees of Nature had
linked their destiny with the will and conduct of the
Household whose welfare they guarded. Mysterious relation!
you exclaim. True; and the creatures of the Universe
are bound to one another and to the Great Whole in
relations whose mystery none has fathomed, and which
perplex the wisest. So what could the Brownies do, or
what could men do in like estate, but continue steadfast in
watching and duty, and do their best to change the wills
upon whose action turned weal or woe, success or failure?</p>

<p>The truth is, Governor Wille had fallen into bad
ways. It was a proud day to the Brownies, and joyously
had they celebrated it, when their friend had been
elected Governor of the Great State of Ohio. But joy
had been turned into mourning. New faces began to be
seen around Hillside, and they carried little spiritual
force and beauty upon them. Rude voices, coarse laughter,
profane words, angry tones were no longer strange
sounds in the Wille Mansion.</p>

<p>The lads who read this will soon be voters. Let them
mark this: the man who goes into political life must
take heed or he will be swept away from safe moorings
by a class of so-called "party friends," who are poor
companions and worse counsellors, and who elbow and
crowd away the best elements of community. Now,
Governor Wille did not take heed. He gave himself
up to those who surrounded him for low, selfish ends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and drifted under their convoy into perilous channels.
As the Governor fell off from the good old ways, the
Pixies triumphed at Hillside, and the Brownies lost
control. That was the state of things when these
Records began. Indeed, it had well nigh come to such
a pass with the Brownies that they ceased to ask: How
shall we beat back the Pixies? and were beginning to
wonder, How shall we escape with our lives?</p>

<p>There could not have been a better leader than Bruce.
He was bold but prudent, having courage without rashness.
He was cool, hopeful and persevering. All the
fairies loved and trusted him. He had risked his life a
hundred times for them and theirs. He was covered
with scars. Amidst all troubles and losses he had not
lost heart. But now he was cast down and doubtful.</p>

<p>Never did captain have a better helper than Lieutenant
MacWhirlie. Active, tireless, with spirits that
never drooped, and zeal that never flagged; prompt,
obedient, brave and intelligent, MacWhirlie was a
model officer. His one fault was that he sometimes
failed in caution; careless of his own life, he was apt to
risk unduly the lives of his men. But in the wild,
guerilla warfare that the Brownies waged, such a fault
seemed very like a virtue. Therefore the Lieutenant
was loved by his troopers and honored by all. Affairs
were truly serious when MacWhirlie became discouraged;
and he was discouraged now, beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>The fact that the Pixies were fortified upon the lawn,
and encamped therein, bag and baggage, was bad enough.
Yet this difficulty, courage, patience and skill might
overcome. But the destiny which linked their success
with the behavior of Governor Wille, bore heavily upon
the good Brownies since the Governor had taken to evil
ways. Therefore the Captain and Lieutenant set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with heavy hearts for the Mansion. A crowd of Brownies
followed a little way behind their officers. They saw
them cross the Lawn, spring into the great Sugar maple
tree, run along the lowest limbs and swing themselves
upon the sill of the chamber window. The window was
open. Governor Wille sat beside it in an easy chair,
reading a newspaper, and enjoying the fresh morning air.</p>

<p>The Brownies saluted him. He dropped his paper
and answered the greeting heartily.</p>

<p>"Welcome, good brothers, a thousand welcomes!"
His tone grew less cheery as he spoke the last words, for
his eye caught the grave bearing and sad faces of his
visitors. He knew at once that they must have come
on serious business. Indeed, he might have guessed that
at first, for except at Christmas times, and on birthday
and wedding anniversaries, the Brownies rarely entered
the Mansion unless some urgent need required. They
were always near at hand, the Governor well knew, and
hovered about house and grounds doing kindly deeds
in secret. But the family did not often hear or see
them. In fact, Governor Wille had been so busy, and
was away from home so often, that he had lost much of
the old family interest in the gentle little people who
loved and guarded him and his so tenderly. Yet, he
had not wholly forgotten them. They had visited him
several times of late with complaints about their own
dangers, and warnings about his. He had thought
lightly of the matter, and of that, indeed, he was a little
ashamed. But, then, he was so busy!</p>

<p>He rose from his chair. "Brothers," he said, "Your
sober faces bode a gloomy message. I know you are
never pleased to waste words. Speak your errand freely.
What troubles you?"</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 23.&mdash;The Pixies Spinning Gossamer over the Eyes of Governor
Wille and Dido.</span>
</div>

<p>"Brother Wille," answered Bruce, "we bring nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
new. It is the old trouble about the Pixies the same
complaint and warning that we have urged upon you of
late more than once. Our enemies&mdash;and well you know
they are yours too!&mdash;are pressing closely upon us. They
have driven us to the lawn at last, and even upon that
they have built their fort and camp. A little space
further and we must flee into the house. And what
most troubles us is that they will follow us. Ah, brother
Wille, our hearts are sad at the thought of Pixies filling
your home! We have done our best and we come to
you for aid. You must help us drive back these wicked
spirits. That is our petition, and our request."</p>

<p>The two Brownies stood quietly with their bonnets or
Scotch caps under their arms. Governor Wille impatiently
crumpled the paper in his hand, came to the
window and replied. "Tut, tut, Bruce, it certainly can't
be as bad as that. You are a little blue this morning, I
fear. Why, when did Brownies ever give up to Pixies?
It was never heard of!"</p>

<p>"Softly, brother Wille," said the Captain. "That has
often happened, right here at Hillside, too! And it will
happen again you may depend on't, if Wille and Dido do
not soon bestir themselves to help their old home fairies."</p>

<p>Governor Wille hesitated, ahemmed, and at last said:
"I am loath to meddle in this affair, and really, I don't
see that there is such pressing danger. I have little fear
for my good, brave Brownie friends. But,&mdash;I shall talk
to Madam Dido about it, and if she is agreed, look out
for aid, and get your troopers ready for a good chase
after the Pixies."</p>

<p>The two Brownies withdrew, leaving the house by the
way they had entered. They looked sad, although they
tried to hide their feelings from the friends who awaited
their coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the news?" cried the Brownies.</p>

<p>"Nothing as yet," answered Bruce. "But we hope
for good news soon."</p>

<p>"What will come of all this, Captain?" asked MacWhirlie
privately.</p>

<p>"Very little, I fear," was the answer. "I can't think
what has come over the Governor of late. The Pixies
seem to have spun their webs over his heart."</p>

<p>"Over his eyes rather!" said MacWhirlie, "or his
hands and feet. His heart is still true to the Brownies,
I am sure. But he can't or don't understand our
troubles and his own perils."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we shall soon know." With that poor
consolation they sat down on the edge of the lawn by the
gravel walk and waited.</p>

<p>Presently Governor Wille and his wife Dido came out
of the house, and walked slowly up the path. Wille
was relating his interview with the Brownies.</p>

<p>"What do you think, wife? I fancy their stories
about the Pixies are a good deal exaggerated&mdash;by fear
of course I mean, for Brownies are clear truth always.
Bruce said that the lawn was full of their tents and nets.
Do you see them? I cannot see one, and I've been
looking all along the walk."<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, my dear," said the affectionate
Dido. "As for the Pixie snares, I can see no
more of them than you. Perhaps we had better wait a
few days before we interfere."</p>

<p>"A few days!" sighed Bruce, who heard all the conversation.
"It will be too late by that time, I fear!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="chapname">MADAM BREEZE COMES TO THE RESCUE.</p>


<p>"Come!" cried the Captain at last. "Moping is no
part of duty. If Governor Wille won't help us, we
must seek allies in other quarters; and for the rest trust
to our good swords."</p>

<p>He raised his bugle to his lips, and sounded a note or
two, whereat his Adjutant appeared.</p>

<p>"Blythe," said the Captain, "order out my pony, and
get ready to attend me to Hilltop. And you, MacWhirlie,
see that every Brownie is armed and ready for
work of any kind at a moment's warning. No fuss,
please; keep everything quiet as possible. I don't want
Spite the Spy to suspect any unusual movement. He'll
give you credit for a little lack of caution when he finds
you in command;" and the Captain laughed pleasantly
as he said this. "But mind! it mustn't be the genuine
article, now. Try for once to beat Spite at his own
favorite tactics. Draw off the cavalry pickets, but see
that your troopers are ready for the saddle. Look
to the pioneer corps, and see that the axes are in good
order. Saunter around carelessly as you like, but keep
your eyes open. Come, Blythe!"</p>

<p>The last words were spoken to his Adjutant who already
stood holding the Captain's butterfly pony Swallowtail,
as well as his own. The Brownies sprang upon
the creatures' backs and rode away.</p>

<p>MacWhirlie watched the forms of the horsemen until
they were lost to view behind the gable of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
"Heigh-ho!" he sighed, "the time was when the journey
to Hilltop was a safe and pleasant ride. But it's
a bold feat nowadays, with Pixies waiting at every
corner, and their webs flapping on every bush. But
I must e'en leave the Captain with Providence and go
about my own business."</p>

</div>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced when Bruce and
Blythe halted their jaded ponies under the shade of
a laurel bush, a little way from the Lone Aspen on
Hilltop. "Poor fellow!" said the Captain as he stroked
Swallowtail's drooping wings. "It was too bad to bring
you on such a service, with plenty of stouter nags in
the stable! But we had to run the gauntlet of the
Pixies, you know, and those big fellows would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
have got through unnoticed. Think they can carry us
back?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I doubt it, Cap'n," was the answer. "But rest and
a hearty meal may bring 'em around all right."</p>

<p>"Very well; then do you care for them
while I go to the Lone Aspen."</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 25.&mdash;Bruce Whistling for Madam Breeze.</span>
</div>

<p>The Lone Aspen stood on the summit of
the hill. It was
an old tree, with
wide spreading
branches, and great
girth of trunk.
The trunk was hollow,
and covered
with warts. One
of these was quite
near the roots, and
was pierced in the
centre with a hole
which exposed the
hollow within.
Bruce stopped at
the foot of the tree
beneath this opening,
and blew a peculiar note upon a whistle which hung
by a chain about his neck. There was no answer. He
whistled again. Still no response. Along the rough
scales and ridges of bark running up and down the
trunk, a stairway had been made like the rounds of a
ladder. Upon this the Captain climbed towards the
opening. He stepped out upon a bulging wart and
peeped within the tree. It was empty. Again he blew
his whistle. The echoes rolled up and down the hollow
trunk and died away far above toward the branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
where a faint streak of light shone through an opening
like the one in which the Brownie stood.</p>

<p>"This is strange!" exclaimed the Captain. He
turned, and looked up at the Sun through branches of
the tree. "Surely, Madam Breeze should be at the
Lone Aspen at this time of day! However, I must
climb to the window and wait." He sat down on the
window ledge, and as he was tired out by long journeys,
hard labors and sleepless nights, in spite of himself
he fell into a doze.</p>

<p>"Ooo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!"</p>

<p>A sound like the tones of a distant bell awoke him.</p>

<p>"Ha, she has come!" he cried, and jumped to his
feet. Madam Breeze was passing with her attendants
through the door. Her voice sounded through the
hollow trunk as she swept into it. In a moment the
Captain felt her breath upon his cheek, and presently
stood face to face with her at the window.</p>

<p>She kissed him heartily, brushed the hair back caressingly
from his forehead, and addressed him in a
sprightly, kindly way. Madam Breeze was an Elf of
pleasing appearance; plump to the verge of stoutness,
but singularly graceful and airy in all her movements.
She was troubled with an asthma which interrupted her
speech with frequent attacks of coughing and wheezing,
much to her discomfort and the disturbance of her
temper. She had an odd fashion of expanding and
contracting in size either suddenly or gradually. This
occurred oftenest during her attacks of asthma, and to
those who first saw this, the sight was a startling one.</p>

<p>"So my brave little Captain," said the Elf, "you've
been whistling for the Breeze at last, have you? Ah!
I thought you would come to it some day. But you
always were such an independent little body&mdash;hoogh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
And you have come to the little fat lady at last, hey?
Well, I'm heartily glad to see you&mdash;hoogh!&mdash;and you'd
have been welcome long ago&mdash;wheeze! Sit down and
tell me your errand." She bustled about all the while
and kept everything and everybody around her in a
whirl of excitement.</p>

<p>"There, now, I've composed myself to listen&mdash;wheeze!
But I suspect that I know without being told&mdash;hoogh!
However, say on, while I sit here and rock myself."
The merry lady twisted together a couple of boughs into
the shape of a rude swing, and seating herself among
the leaves, swayed back and forth, wheezing, coughing,
oh-ing and ah-ing, while Bruce told the story of his
troubles.</p>

<p>"And now," he concluded, "I appeal to you for
help." He took the whistle from his neck and laid it in
the Elf's hand. "This talisman has always opened a
way for Brownies to the heart and help of you and
yours."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Madam, throwing the chain around
the Captain's neck again, "Put up your whistle&mdash;hoogh!
No need to remind Madam Breeze by that of the claim
of the fairies upon her and hers. And so these horrid
Pixies have worried the life out of you? And you tarried
all this time before coming to me?&mdash;Wheeze,
wheeze! Confound this cough! And you didn't go to
my gentle Lady Zephyr this time, hey? Her balmy
breath wouldn't quite suit your present purpose? Ho,
ho, ho! Good stout Madam Breeze for you, hey?&mdash;Hoogh!
Aha, I see that Brownies, like other folk,
when they get into trouble prefer the useful to the ornamental.
Well, well, you're right enough."</p>

<p>Whereupon the jolly, kind hearted Elf swung and
rolled herself about and made the leaves of the Lone
Aspen fairly dance with the voice of her laughter.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now to business!" Madam Breeze sobered down
just one moment as she spoke. "How did you come
here? On the ponies, hey? Call Blythe."</p>

<p>Bruce blew his bugle. Presently Blythe clambered
up the ladder and saluted the Elf.</p>

<p>"How are the ponies, Blythe? Pretty well done out,
hey? Not fit for the journey back? In a pinch are
you? So I thought. Well, you Brownies do miss it
sometimes, you must confess." Madam ran on asking
and answering her own questions without giving Blythe
a chance to speak a word. However, she seemed, through,
some mysterious news agency of her own, to know everything
without information from the Brownies.</p>

<p>"Need fresh horses? Just as I supposed. Here, here&mdash;Whirlit,&mdash;wheeze,&mdash;hoogh!
(Confound that cough!)
Blythe, call Whirlit for me. The rascal!&mdash;he's always
out of the way when I want him."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the bad character given him by his
mistress, Whirlit was at the window in a moment.</p>

<p>"There, keep still now, and listen!" Madam herself
was quite as restless as the frisky Whirlit while she gave
her orders, bouncing back and forth all the time among
the leaves. "Still, I say! Put Swallowtail and Blythe's
pony in the stable, and get out my Goldtailed matches.
Order all hands to be ready to leave immediately.
Quick! Off with you!"</p>

<p>Whirlit sprang from the window, turning a score of
somersaults or more on his way to the ground. He returned
presently, leading a pair of Goldtailed moths.
They were beautiful insects with soft downy plumage,
snowy white color, and a tuft of yellow hair at the end
of the tail.</p>

<p>"Aren't they beauties," cried Madam, casting an admiring
glance at her splendid matches. "And fast, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
And thoroughly trained. And what's the strangest
thing about them, they're not worth an old straw in the
day time. They hang around on the bark here as
spiritless as a toadstool. But the moment evening comes
they spruce up, and hie&mdash;away! they're brisk enough
then. Queer, isn't it? But I keep 'em just for night
work. Now we're all ready for a bout with the Pixies.
Pooh! the nasty beasts! I hate to soil my breath with
them and their clammy snares. But Brownies can't be
left to suffer. Ready, Captain? Yes? very well, then,
mount and away!"</p>

<p>The afternoon was nearly gone. Below Hilltop the
woods, orchard, house, lawn and garden all lay in shadow.
The Goldtailed matches were in fine spirits. Their
energetic mistress kept close behind them buoying them
up, and urging them on, and in a short time they reached
the spring at the foot of the orchard back of the mansion.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Madam Breeze. "I shall wait here
in the tops of the trees, while you move forward and get
your Brownies ready. Be quick, now, and when you
want me, remember the whistle."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="chapname">ATTACK ON THE OLD LODGE.</p>


<p>Bruce put spurs to Goldtail and flew across the
garden followed closely by Blythe. They reached the
Lawn and crossed the Brownie camp. They stopped at
the Captain's headquarters under the Rose Bush.
Everything was in confusion. MacWhirlie was pacing
back and forth in high excitement; a group of Brownies
surrounded him, talking and gesticulating violently.</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried MacWhirlie, stopping suddenly,
facing the excited group. "I tell you that I will not
stir a hand in this thing until Captain Bruce returns, or
until it is settled that he will not return this night. I love
Rodney as fondly as you; he is my dearest friend, the
Captain's own brother, my comrade in a thousand fights
and forays. But it would bring on a battle were I to
consent to follow my own heart and your wishes.
That would ruin us all. I cannot; dare not, will not!
I must obey my orders. Silence, I say!"</p>

<p>Bruce leaped from Goldtail's back and walked hastily
into the midst of the group. The Brownies did not
notice him until he stood by MacWhirlie's side.</p>

<p>A clamor of surprise, satisfaction, and grief greeted
him. The Lieutenant's face brightened; then clouded
again, as with sympathy and pain.</p>

<p>"Speak, MacWhirlie," said the Captain. "What has
happened? What is wrong with Rodney? Quick, and
tell the worst at once."</p>

<p>"He is shut up by the Pixies along with his boy
Johnny."</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig_27" id="Fig_27"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, Rodney captured! I never would have
thought it. How did it come about?"</p>

<p>"It was not exactly his own fault, Sir. He had been
busy about the boats all day&mdash;you know we were to
have everything in order,&mdash;and I had asked him to look
after his sailors. He took Johnny with him&mdash;not an
hour ago, Sir,&mdash;to have a last look at matters. He did
not want to take the little fellow, but the lad was bent
on going; and besides he is a brisk young Brownie, and
quite able to look after himself. Rodney was busy at
the rivulet about some naval affairs and left the boy for
a few moments on shore. Just then one of the butterfly
ponies flew by and strolled off toward the Pixie picket
line. Johnny saw its danger and ran to bring it back.
He had gone but a little way when he was seized by one
of the Pixie scouts, who are always hovering around now,
and clapped into one of our old lodges which they have
covered with spinningwork and are using as a guard
house."<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>"But Rodney? How came he into their hands?"
the Captain cried.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. The Commodore heard
Johnny's cries, sprang on shore, and rushed upon the old
wretch who had captured the lad, and who was spinning
a rope across the door. He cut him down with one blow
of his cutlass and ran into the lodge to get Johnny."</p>

<p>"Ha! that was well done!" exclaimed Bruce.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, but he wasn't quick enough. A squad of
pickets heard the fuss, and before Rodney could repass
the door they had blocked it up with their snares, double
lashed and sealed it, and,&mdash;there they are!"</p>

<p>"How did you find out all this?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, some of the sailors also heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
boy's cries and followed the Commodore; but only in
time to see how things had gone. They ran back to the
camp, and here they are, clamoring, threatening, pleading
to get me to order all hands to the rescue of Rodney
and his boy."</p>

<p>"Have you done anything?"</p>

<p>"I have set guards to watch the lodge and report continually
how things go. For the rest I have tried to
keep the camp in perfect quiet."</p>

<p>"How goes it with the prisoners; are they well?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Pipe the Boatswain, "the Commodore
has his boy in the very furthest end of the lodge, and he
stays there walking back and forth before the lad, cutlass
in hand. They haven't dared to molest him yet. He
sounded his bugle once or twice, and I know he wonders
why his friends, especially his old tars, have deserted
him. It's well nigh broke our hearts, Cap'n."</p>

<p>"It was hard to resist the pressure, Captain," said
MacWhirlie, "and harder still to control my own heart.
But I did what I thought my duty. I stand ready to
suffer for it if I erred. And now that you are back all
I ask is to lead the rescue. I will save Rodney and his
boy, or leave my carcass with the Pixies."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Bruce, "you did quite right.
God bless you for your love of me and mine but especially
bless you for your firmness on this occasion. It
would have been a sad day for us all if the life of our
nation had been risked for the sake of one however dear
to me and to us all. Now, get ready for action! Is all
in order for the assault?"</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>"Then rally the men. We will advance with all our
force. We must first save Rodney and his boy. Then
we shall clean out the whole Pixie nest. The battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
word is 'Rescue.' Madam Breeze waits yonder in the
orchard to join us."</p>

<p>How the order flew through the Brownie camp!
Love for Rodney, and the news of the near presence of
their powerful ally put hope and courage into all hearts.
Every man was in his place. Even the older boys had
taken arms, hoping for permission to join in the battle
or at least the chase.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_28" id="Fig_28"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 28.&mdash;A Tubeweaver&#39;s Den.</span>
</div>

<p>The Captain led his men swiftly and cautiously by a
roundabout route to the site of the old lodge, which was
at the extreme eastern
flank of the
Pixie camp. He
skirted the Lawn,
passed the spring,
and struck the
bank of the rivulet
at the foot of the
orchard. There he
waited until the
full moon had risen
above the hills, and
slanted her rays
along the river and
into the bosom of
little Lake Katrine.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the Captain at last.</p>

<p>"Hark," the word passed in a whisper along the line.</p>

<p>Up in the tree tops Madam Breeze and her train were
waiting for the signal. Not waiting patiently, indeed,
for they rocked and rolled among the round topped
apple trees, and swung to and fro among the tall pears,
rustling the leaves, shaking down the fruit, and whistling
among the branches. But there they were, all
ready, eager to rush upon their foes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brownies had now reached a point well to the
east of the Pixie camp and fort. Just beyond them
was the lodge, now changed into a tubeweaver's den,
in which the Commodore and his boy were confined.
Captain Bruce halted the column and distributed the
men throughout the tall grass. He formed a half circle
looking toward the old lodge, the pioneers or axmen
being in the centre.</p>

<p>"Steady, now, a moment," he exclaimed in a low tone
to MacWhirlie. He fell upon hands and knees and
glided through the grass. He was back in a few
moments.</p>

<p>"It is all right. Not more than a dozen Pixies are
on guard, the rest are beyond the demilune in the camp
at supper, carousing, singing and making merry over
Rodney's capture. Poor fellow! He is seated in the
far end of the lodge holding Johnny on his lap. The
boy has cried himself asleep. The Commodore has one
hand on his sword and rests his face upon the other.
Neither friend nor foe seems to be expecting us."</p>

<p>"Attention!" The order ran in low whispers around
the line.</p>

<p>"Ready!"</p>

<p>"Ready." This word passed from officer to officer in
the same way.</p>

<p>Then the Captain stepped to the head of the axmen,
put his whistle to his lips and blew a long blast. The
shrill notes cut through the air. Rodney heard it, lifted
up his boy, leaped to his feet and cried:</p>

<p>"Come, Johnny, up! Wake! It is a rescue!"</p>

<p>The Pixie guards heard it. They grasped their
weapons, and crowded together before the door of the
lodge. Spite the Spy and his horde heard it as they
feasted and made merry. They hastily seized their arms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's in the wind, now?" muttered Spite. "That
beast of a Bruce is at the bottom of it, I warrant." But
none of them seemed seriously to expect an attack. The
Brownie camp had been quiet all day. Their Captain
was known to be absent; their Commodore was a prisoner;
there had been no sign of any unusual stir.</p>

<p>Up in the orchard where she swung impatiently among
the tree tops, good Madam Breeze heard the same call.</p>

<p>"Ah! there it goes at last. Thank our star for that.
What! Whirlit, Whisk, Keener and all the rest of you,
do you hear? Up and away&mdash;away! Oo&mdash;oo&mdash;Ooh!"</p>

<p>The Brownies were crouched in the grass, every
nerve strained to the utmost, every eye fixed eagerly
upon their leader, awaiting the word of command. It
came at last. Bruce dropped his whistle, drew his
broadsword, and shouted the welcome word, "Charge!"</p>

<p>With a wild hurrah the column closed in upon the
lodge, MacWhirlie leading one wing, Pipe the other,
and Bruce at the head of the axmen leading the centre.</p>

<p>It was a complete surprise. The guard of Pixies
broke, parting to right and left. One squad fell into
the hands of the sailors and were all slain. The others
fared little better with MacWhirlie and his troopers.
The door gave way before the strokes that the Captain
and his pioneers rained upon it, and Rodney with his
boy in his arms sprang out. Three times three hearty
cheers rang in the evening air as the brave hearted
sailor came forth a free man.</p>

<p>"Brother Rodney," said Captain Bruce, "there is not
even time for greeting. Send your boy to the rear.
Take command of your men. We are to charge the
whole Pixie camp and fort. Madam Breeze is behind
us. You know the rest. Forward!"</p>

<p class="chapname">HOW THE FORT WAS SAVED.</p>


<p>By this time the Pixies in the main camp had recovered
from their surprise. The Brownies' battle-cry
"Rescue" showed plainly the object of the assault. The
Pixies were used to war's alarms; and, as for their
leader, Spite, lack of promptness and skill was not
among his faults. Therefore Rodney had scarcely been
set free ere Spite had his followers in line. However,
he did not expect an attack upon himself, for he fancied
that the Brownies had been too much cowed lately to
venture upon the offensive. He thought they would be
satisfied with rescuing Rodney, and would then retreat,
and that he determined to prevent.</p>

<p>"Come, my lads," he shouted, "we must not let these
creatures escape us this time. Teach them what it is to
break into a Pixie camp. Fall on them! Give no
quarter; spare no one, let your battle-cry be 'Death!'"
He ran to the front as he spoke, shaking in one hand a
poisoned dart and holding in the other his war club.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 30.&mdash;Elf Whirlit Comes to the Rescue of Captain Bruce.&mdash;(Illustration

</div>

<p>The Pixies followed keenly enough, shouting their
terrible watchword. But their confidence was dashed as
they saw the Brownies, so far from retreating, actually
forming their line of battle in front of the demilune.
The Pixies paused at this sight. Even Spite hesitated
a moment. In that moment a shower of arrows rained
upon them from the Brownie bows. Then with a ringing
cheer the brave fairies charged. The two columns
closed. Above the clash of weapons and clamor of
battle were heard ever and anon the voices of the Pixies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
sounding the war cry "Death," and the cheery tenor of
the Brownies answering with the sweet word "Rescue."</p>

<p>The leaders of the two parties were in the thickest of
the fight. Spite was well seconded by his two lieutenants,
Heady and Hide, and the rank and file of the
Pixies behaved valiantly. The Brownies had gained
much by their first onset upon the picket line and outposts,
but, on the other hand were far the weaker party.
It were hard to say which army might have won the
fight had they been left to themselves; but this was not
to be. Madam Breeze swept down upon the struggling
lines. For a moment she hovered over the battle confused
and angry at the prospect.</p>

<p>"Why, what can I do?" she cried. "Here, Whirlit,
Keener, Bluster&mdash;you rogues, stop I say! Don't you
see?&mdash;hoogh! You can do nothing against the Pixies
without injuring the Brownies. They're so mixed together
that I can scarce tell one from the other."</p>

<p>Whirlit had already thrown himself into the midst of
the fight. He espied Captain Bruce and bounded to
his side. Two great Pixies were rushing upon the Captain
with uplifted spears, and wide open mouths from
which terrible fangs were thrust. With one puff of
his keen breath Whirlit sent both these warriors spinning
and tumbling in the dust.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" cried the Captain, "That was a kindly
service right bravely done." Whirlit threw himself
over and over again as a token of his satisfaction, and
then said:</p>

<p>"Madam awaits your orders. She fears to mix in
the fight lest she may do more harm than good. What
shall we do? Make haste, please, the old lady is very
much excited and won't wait long. She'll be in mischief
if&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence, Sir!" said the Captain sternly. "Don't
speak in such terms of your mistress. Tell Madam
Breeze with my compliments, to knock over the Pixie
camp, houses and fort, and leave the enemy themselves
to us."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Whirlit as he leaped into the
air. "A peppery Brownie, that! Served me right, however."</p>

<p>He found Madam Breeze almost bursting with anger,
confusion, anxiety, excitement and the exertion of self-restraint.</p>

<p>"You imp of ingratitude!" she began, "how could
you dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madam," cried Whirlit, interrupting her, "the Captain
says, with his compliments, you will please knock
over the Pixie camp, tents, houses, fort and all!"</p>

<p>Madam's brow cleared in a moment. "That I will,"
she answered in her usual jovial tones. "Hie&mdash;away, my
hearties! come, come now! 'Blow, ye winds, and
crack your cheeks!'"</p>

<p>Thereupon Madam Breeze and her company fell upon
the Pixie camp. The breastwork or demilune that had
been woven around the outer bounds was leveled in an
instant. Then the clamorous crew fell upon the circle
of huts and tents that stood next within. It was not so
easy work here.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" shouted Whirlit, as he threw himself,
with full force, back foremost, against one of the broad
canvas sides. "Ugh!" was the next exclamation heard
from him as he bounded back like an india-rubber ball
and fell sprawling among tent pins and ropes.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" The merry laugh of Madam Breeze
rolled out through the hurly-burly at this discomfiture
of her page. "Try it again, Whirlie, it's easily done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
you know! You'd make a fine base ball, now, wouldn't
you? Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Whirlit did try again; then Whisk and Bluster and
Keener; and last of all Madam Breeze threw her round
body against the tent. The ropes snapped, the walls
tumbled together, and in a trice the noisy Breezes had
sent ropes, canvas, and poles streaming away into the
air, broken into a hundred pieces.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>One after another the Pixies' dens, nests, tents, huts,
barns and storehouses shared the same fate at the hands
of the busy wreckers. In a few moments the ruins of
the camp were scattered in confused heaps upon the
earth, or were floating off upon the wings of the storm.
The females, or Pixinees, who with their broods of young
had been left in possession of the camp, at first showed
fight. But they soon saw that resistance was vain, and
fled into the fort, where they hid themselves in the
sheltered corners and angles, or cowered against the
lee side of pebbles, leaves, clumps of grass, and the
various rubbish that littered the ground.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>All this time, the conflict was raging between the
Brownies and Pixies outside the barricade. Great as
was the clamor raised at the overthrow of the camp, the
noise of battle was so loud and the feelings of the combatants
so intense, that none knew what havoc Madam
Breeze was making. A lad ran into the rear line of the
Pixie troops calling for the chief.</p>

<p>"Back to your mother, boy," was the gruff response,
"and leave the battle to warriors."</p>

<p>"But mother has fled into the fort. The house is
broken down. The camp is attacked. The barricades
are leveled. Everything is ruined. I must see the
Captain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p><p>The evil tidings rapidly spread, and even before it
reached the chief the line began to waver, and fall back
toward the camp. Spite fell into a towering rage when
the message was brought to him. He cursed Madam
Breeze. He cursed the Pixie who stopped the messenger,
and thus caused the bad news to spread. He cursed
Bruce and the Brownies. He cursed his own eyes, also,
although he might have saved himself that trouble, for
they had never been a blessing to anybody.</p>

<p>"But cursing won't mend matters, Chief," said Lieutenant
Hide. "The fort still stands; we can fall back
to that, and save what we may."</p>

<p>"Drummer, sound the retreat," cried Spite; "and
Hide, do you fall back with the right wing to the fort.
Orderly, bid Lieutenant Heady take command and
cover the retreat. Tell him to fight every inch of
ground."</p>

<p>Then Spite turned upon his heels and hurried to the
rear. In truth, he was not sorry for an excuse to withdraw
from the fight. He stumbled over the ruins of
the camp at every step. It was a complete wreck. Not
a tent, not a building of any kind remained, except the
fort, to which he bent his course. It was a huge structure,
as we have seen, braced and strengthened by every
art and effort at the Pixies' command. But Spite's
heart failed him as he looked around, and saw how
everything else in camp had vanished away before the
mighty breath of his adversaries.</p>

<p>"See!" he exclaimed, "Madam Breeze and her train
have just attacked the fort. Will it hold out, I wonder?"
With this thought in mind he hurried forward.</p>

<p>Keener saw him coming, and recognized him at once.
"There comes Spite the Spy!" he shouted. "At him,
boys! let us toss him in one of his own sticky blankets!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye," answered Whisk, "suppose we fling him
over the horns of the moon, and let him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him stick there," cried Whirlit, finishing the
sentence. Whereat the trio pounced pell-mell upon the
Pixie chief.</p>

<p>"Very well, my lads," exclaimed Madam Breeze,
"you're quite welcome to a monopoly of the old beast.
Phooh! How he smells of poison! He well nigh takes
my breath. Fort smashing suits me better." With
these words she threw herself against the Agalena wing
of Fort Spinder. Every cord and canvas in it shook
with the violence of the onset. But it was unbroken.
Again and again the stout Elf cast herself against the
walls; the cords creaked and seemed about to part, but
so elastic were they that they swayed inward with a
heavy surge and then back again. The weeds, blades
of grass and twigs to which the ropes and beams were
fastened bent under the weight of the blast, but were
unbroken.</p>

<p>All this time Spite was struggling with the three
Elves. They pinched his skin, they plucked at his
cheek, mouth and nostrils. They almost blinded him
with blasts which they cast full into his eyes. They
pulled his clothes, and held him by the limbs. But he
kept on his path. Stoutly, stubbornly he fought his way
step by step until he stood at last before the gate of the
fort. He was seen at once, and a dozen of the inmates
ran forward to admit him.</p>

<p>"Not for your lives!" he shouted. "Don't leave a
crack open, if you can help it, for these blusterers to enter.
It would be ruin to open the gate."</p>

<p>He looked around him. Hide and his party were
still a goodly distance away. He could hear above the
voices of the storm the rousing cheers of the Brownies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
as they pressed more and more closely upon Heady, who
was doggedly giving way, disputing every inch of ground.
Whirlit, Whisk and Keener had left him, at the beck
of Madam Breeze, and now joined that lusty Elf in
their assaults upon Fort Spinder.</p>

<p>"What is done, must be done quickly," thought Spite.
"May all the furies seize the old monster! She has
broken a breach in the roof. See! the garrison, aided
by the women and children, are doing bravely. There;
that villain Keener has cut his way to the inside of Fort
Agalena. And there go Whisk and Whirlit after him.
How the walls sway back and forth! The roof bulges
upward. The reprobates! They are trying to break
through the roof. If they do that and Madam Breeze
gets in, all is lost; away will go the whole building with
a crash. What shall I do? If we could only anchor
the roof! But there's no ballast about. Hide and his
men are far away yet. Confusion seize them! Why
aren't they here now?"</p>

<p>It was a trying moment for the interests of the Pixies.
All seemed to turn upon the fate of the fort; and that
to depend upon one person. But that person was Spite
the Spy, and he had never yet been wholly without
resources. Hopeless as the case appeared, he was equal
to the emergency. He would save the fort if it could
be saved! He jumped from the weed-top which he had
mounted for better observation, and plunged into the
midst of the ruins of the camp. He stopped before
a pebble almost the size of his own body.</p>

<p>"That will do, I think," he muttered. He seized the
stone, twisted a cable around it, and dragged it away
toward the fort. It was but a moment's work to climb
upon an overhanging weed, fasten the cable to a branch
and swing the stone over upon the roof. The canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
sheet sank downward under the pebble's weight. Spite
watched it with keen interest. The elastic stuff swayed
upward and downward several times, and seemed about
to settle firmly, when Whirlit leaped upward against it
with his strong shoulders. The pebble flew off the roof,
spinning through the air close to the head of the Pixie
chief, who looked on from his perch among the leaves.</p>

<p>"Failure!" muttered Spite.</p>

<p>"Try again, old fellow!" shouted Whirlit from the
inside, where he was capering in high good humor above
the heads of the enraged
inmates.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 251px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 31.&mdash;&quot;He Jumped from the Weed Top.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Good advice,"
Spite responded with
feigned cheerfulness;
"I will try again.
And succeed next
time, too!"</p>

<p>A mocking laugh
followed him as he
swung himself down
the weed by his rope
ladder, and hurried
off again into the
ruined camp. On&mdash;on&mdash;on!
He stopped
at last.</p>

<p>"This is it&mdash;the very thing. But, can I manage it?"
He stood before a broken twig as thick as his own body
and five or six times as long as himself. Think of a
man carrying a log as thick as himself and twenty-five
or thirty feet long! That was something like the feat
that Spite undertook.</p>

<p>"But I can do it," he said; "I <i>must</i> do it!" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
energy and strength of despair were upon him. He
seized the beam with his long arms, bowed himself to
the burden and lifted it. Tottering with the weight,
and stumbling over the debris of the desolate village,
he laid down the beam at last at the foot of the tall weed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 263px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Boy's Illustration.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 32.&mdash;Spite the Spy Climbs a Weed to Reconnoitre.</span>
</div>

<p>The task was not
ended. He twisted
a cable around the
log and mounted
into the foliage.
He stood a hundred
times his own
height above the
weight he wished
to lift. Would he
ever get it up? We
shall see! He
hauled upon his
rope until it was
stretched to its utmost.
Then one
end of the stick
slowly rose above
the earth; up&mdash;up&mdash;until
the other
end was in the air.
See! it swings quite
free. It is rising
higher and higher. Hand over hand, the strong and
patient workman is drawing the beam slowly and surely
toward the top of the plant.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>Madam Breeze began to be concerned about this new
effort of Spite's. A few more stout assaults and the
roof must give way dragging with it walls and all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>But what if Spite should manage to get his great log
anchor on it? It would hold the roof so steady that no
power at her command could move it. Moreover, it
would bear the roof down toward the ground, and so
prevent Whirlit, Keener, and Whisk from breaking
through by stretching the elastic cords upward until
they snapped. They could make no headway by
pressing downward since the earth stayed the cords in
that direction. And how could they heave the roof upward
with a great log lying on it?</p>

<p>"I don't want to begin this affair all over again,"
quoth Madam Breeze, "for in sooth, I'm pretty well
out of breath now&mdash;wheeze! A few more turns will
use me up. Therefore, my good Mr. Spite, I fear
that I must interfere with this logging business of
yours."</p>

<p>So saying, she flung herself upon the beam, as it
hung far up in the air, slowly mounting to its place. It
swayed up and down a moment, as an object fastened to
an elastic thread will do, and then&mdash;crash! the rope
snapped, and the log fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Not a whit discouraged by this disaster, Spite looped
the end of the cable over the weed, and before Madam
had fairly got her breath again, he had made fast the
log, reascended the bush, and was pulling might and
main upon the rope.</p>

<p>He had his reward. There was no second breaking
of the cable, although Madam Breeze threw her weight
upon the log. It reached its position. It hung nearly
over the roof. Spite tied the rope, crept out upon the
branch, reached down to the log, and with one push of
his long arm swung it inward and over the roof. At
the same time he cut the cable. The log dropped to its
place. The roof that had been bulging out, just ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to burst, sank into its true position. The walls were
anchored now. The fort was saved!<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>Madam Breeze gathered all her strength for a last
onset. Whirlit, Whisk, and Keener on the inside vigorously
seconded her attempt.
But it failed.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 291px;"><a name="Fig_33" id="Fig_33"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 33.&mdash;A Spider Drawing up a Swathed Grasshopper

</div>

<p>"Well, well," said Madam,
"I give it up! I'm out of
breath&mdash;clear blowed&mdash;hoogh!
I've scarce wind enough to get
home with&mdash;wheeze! Come
out of that, lads. Our work
is done for to-day."</p>

<p>The three Elves crept,
rather crestfallen, out of the
opening in the roof made by
the pebble, and the whole
party without more ado, or
another word, puffed back to
Lone Aspen. Spite
sat upon the branch
and watched their departure.
He
rubbed his
hands, and
said, "Aha!"
He knew
that he had
done a deed that would gain him glory among the
Pixies. That was pleasant; but after all, that which
pleased him best was the thought that he had saved a
Pixie fort from which to plot and war against the good
Brownies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes,
my dears,
one may be
clever, wise
and accomplished,
but
very, very bad
withal. As poet
Burns truly sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heart aye's the part aye<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">That maks us right or wrang."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 34.&mdash;An Orbweb with a Pebble Counterpoise.</span>
</div>

<p>Hide and his company
of Pixies came up to the
fort soon after Madam
Breeze and her retainers
had gone. The south gate was thrown open,
and the inmates ran out and mingled with their
friends, loudly praising the deed by which Spite
had saved the fort. The hero of all this praise
sat quietly on his perch resting, surveying the
field, and thinking. He had need of his wisest
thoughts; for the victorious Brownies were
already beyond the outer line of the demilune,
steadily driving Heady and his division
before them.</p>

<p>Spite dropped to the ground by the cable that
still swung upon the bush. "Go back into the
fort," he said to the fugitives. "Your own
homes are gone, and that will be the safest
place for you now. As for us," addressing
the soldiers, "we must make a last stand here
and keep it. The sun is nearly down. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
can hold the position for a little longer, night will bring
relief, and give time for some plan that shall change the
fortune of battle. Advance!"</p>

<p>The line moved forward to support Heady. The site
of the fort was well chosen for defence. It stood upon
a swelling height of the lake shore, with a space of
smooth grass in front. On this little plain, a short distance
beyond the height, at Spite's command the Pixies
began putting up a breastwork. They wrought rapidly,
weaving together grass blades, leaves
and twigs, and spinning between them
ropes and webs. Spite, himself, with
a few of the ablest warriors went to
assist Heady in holding back the
Brownies. The plan succeeded; by
the time the fighting force was ready
to fall back, the workers
had thrown up a rampart
behind which the entire
army retreated in good order.
A series of skirmishes
began along the line of
breastworks, but the evening
shadows soon fell and separated the combatants.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/fig_035.jpg" width="226" height="275" alt="Fig. 35.&mdash;How a Spider Drops to the Ground." title="Fig. 35.&mdash;How a Spider Drops to the Ground." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;How a Spider Drops to the Ground.</span>
</div>

<p>The Brownies were in fine spirits. They were confident
of complete victory on the morrow. A line of
cavalry pickets, under Lieutenant MacWhirlie, was
posted throughout the plain, which skirted nearly three-fourths
of the knoll on which the fort stood. These
pickets were ordered to keep moving the whole night,
thus keeping strict guard upon the Pixies at the points
whence they were most likely to make a sally or seek to
escape. Sentinels were also placed on the lake side or
rear of the fort. In that quarter the bank sloped toward
the lake, and was dotted with bushes that straggled
singly and in clumps to the water's edge. Soon the camp
fires and lanterns of the Brownie army were glimmering
along the outer border of the plain and through the
copse by the lake side. They looked like fire-flies dancing
among the boughs, and indeed they were encaged
fire-flies, or bits of fox-fire from decayed stumps. As
the whole country was now open to Captain Bruce, he
had no trouble in securing supplies for his troops, so
that the Brownies went to the night's rest or duty with
refreshed bodies as well as hopeful spirits.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Matters were not so pleasant with the Pixies. The
provisions laid up within Fort Spinder were not abundant,
and Spite had to order all to be put upon short
rations. Moreover, their hunting ground was quite limited,
of course, and the game on which they were used
to prey had been frightened off by the late commotions.
However, the lights from the watch fires of their enemies
drew some unwary and over curious night wanderers
within the confines of the fort, and the hungry Pixies
were able to catch a few of them. As for Spite, their
chief, he was silent and moody. After mounting the
guards, and giving necessary orders, he threw himself
upon the ground, wrapped his blanket around him and
began to think. We shall learn the fruits of his plotting,
by and by.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">THE SANITARY CORPS.</p>


<p>In the centre of the Brownie camp were three large
tents, the officers' headquarters, the hospital tent, and the
marquée of the Sanitary Corps. These were wrought
out of large leaves, deftly stretched upon frames, with
edges overlapping like a tiled roof, and anchored to the
ground by small pebbles, heaps of sand, and by tent
pins of thorns or splinters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig_037.jpg" width="500" height="285"
alt="Fig. 37.&mdash;The Hospital Tent and Marquée of the Sanitary Corps."
title="Fig. 37.&mdash;The Hospital Tent and Marquée of the Sanitary Corps." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 37.&mdash;The Hospital Tent and Marquée of the Sanitary Corps.</span>
</div>

<p>The Headquarters' tent was occupied by the chief
officers, Bruce, Rodney, MacWhirlie and Pipe. The
Hospital tent was devoted to the sick and wounded.
But one would not easily imagine who were the occupants
of the Sanitary tent; we shall therefore lift the
door of the marquée, and peep within.</p>

<p>It is a snug place. In the centre, well up toward the
roof, a large fox-fire lantern hangs from the ridge pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
which sheds a soft light throughout the interior. A
strong odor of herbs and ointments fills the place, the
reason for which soon appears. Four wee Brownie
women are busy with retorts, jars, boxes, lint, bandages,
and various other articles of the healing art.</p>

<p>The oldest of the party, judged by our human standard,
has reached that uncertain boundary of womanhood
which divides maiden from matron. One might venture
to call her an "old maid" Brownie, and perhaps she
would not deny it, for that is a class&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;whom
the Brownies dearly love. But no one could
aver that the fairy woman had suffered loss of charms
by advance in life. One glance into her face shows how
pure, gentle and good must be the disposition that has
wrought the tracery of such sweet expression around
her features. Her name is Agatha; she is the only
child of Captain Bruce, and one does not wonder,
having once seen her, that even the Brownies call her
Agatha the Good. She is spreading upon tiny bandages
out of a tiny jar some kind of ointment, the recipe for
which you may be sure is in none of our dispensaries,
but which the Brownies call Lily Balm.</p>

<p>The young Brownie who attends her, not as handmaid
but companion, is called Grace. Her face is such a
goodly one, her manners are so gentle, easy and winning,
her every movement so graceful, delicate and yet so full
of life, that we shall not be surprised to hear you say:
"Surely, she must be the Fairy Queen herself!"</p>

<p>At the other end of the tent, kneeling over a brazier
filled with coals, is the third member of the Sanitary
Corps. She holds above the coals a retort, in which she
is distilling Lily Balm. Her back is toward us and her
face is hidden. There! you have caught a glimpse of it
as she turned her head to speak to her companion. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
cheeks are flushed, the eyes are bright with the glow of
the coals, there is an earnest, pitiful look in their deep
blue that speaks of thought intent upon present duty.
But there is also a strange light therein, a light as from
some far away world, that throws an air of mystery
around this person and bids your thoughts pause reverently
as they run on in judgment concerning her. This
is Faith, the daughter of Rodney the Commodore. She
is young as the Brownies count years, and was born "at
sea," that is, upon the Lake Katrine of Brownieland,
through which flows the Rivulet at the foot of the
Orchard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

alt="Fig. 38.&mdash;A Peep Inside the Sanitary Tent. Faith Distilling Lily-Balm."
title="Fig. 38.&mdash;A Peep Inside the Sanitary Tent. Faith Distilling Lily-Balm." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 38.&mdash;A Peep Inside the Sanitary Tent. Faith Distilling Lily-Balm.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>At Faith's side is her companion and friend, Sophia,
the daughter of Pipe, the Boatswain. There is a mixture
of boldness and shyness in her manner that strikes
one at once. Her movements have the snap and
positiveness of a practical woman. Her eyes sparkle
with intelligence; there is in them a keen, questioning
look which tells that she loves not only to know, but to
know the reason why. If she were not a Brownie you
would probably say she was a pushing sort of person;
that you scarcely could decide whether she was more
curious or sincere, more dreamy or practical, more
skeptical or credulous. But that she is beautiful you
would not hesitate to say. She is busy among the herbs,
sorting them, making ready material for Faith's retort.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen this Sanitary Corps, and
learned their names, you may drop the door of the tent
and we shall go on with the story.</p>

<p>"Come, Grace, we have done quite enough for the
present," said Agatha. "Bring the bandages and let
us go to the Hospital. Have you lint and balm in
your satchel? Very well. That is all we need now.
Faith, hadn't you better leave off distilling, and help
us for a while with the dressing?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you wish it," answered Faith, "and we can
stop now as well as not."</p>

<p>The pots and herbs were set aside, and Faith and
Sophia followed Agatha and Grace through the rear
door of the marquée. They crossed into the Hospital
under a covered way that united the two tents. The
Hospital was a spacious tent, or rather several large
tents or marquées, joined in one. Along each side on
the rude cots hastily made from dried grass and leaves,
lay a number of wounded Brownies. The sufferers
turned their eyes upon the Nurses as they entered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
at once their faces lit up with pleasure. Agatha and
her friends went from couch to couch carrying the blessings
of their healing art. Some of the men had hurts
that had not yet been dressed. These were first carefully
washed. The lint, which the Nurses carried in
their satchels, was laid upon the wound to absorb the
poison, and the balm applied.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_39" id="Fig_39"></a>
<img src="images/fig_039.jpg" width="300" height="258" alt="Fig. 39.&mdash;The Jaws and Fangs." title="Fig. 39.&mdash;The Jaws and Fangs." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 39.&mdash;The Jaws and Fangs.</span>
</div>

<p>A Pixie uses his fangs, when fighting at close quarters,
with terrible effect. His mouth is a tremendous piece
of machinery. The jaws are each armed with a sharp,
movable fang, pierced
near its end. When the
Pixie bites, a poisonous
fluid flows through this
hole into the wound.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>
In battle with Brownies
the Pixies try to come
to close quarters. Being
much larger and
more powerful, they
seize them in their hairy
arms, strike their fangs
into them, and spring back quickly out of reach of the
Brownie's sharp sword or axe. All this is done so
rapidly, that often ere the victim has time to strike a
blow he has been wounded and cast down, and his
assailant is out of reach. The poison leaves a painful
wound in the Brownie's flesh, frequently disabling, but
never killing him unless the heart be reached. Indeed,
no Brownie ever perished by any form of violence
except drowning, suffocation or a heart stroke.</p>

<p>For the hurt made by Pixie fangs the Lily Balm
made by the Sanitary Corps is a sure remedy. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
applied at once upon soft lint, which absorbs the poison,
the relief is immediate. But in any case it will ease
the pain, and in the end cure the wound.</p>

<p>The uses of this balm, and all the services which the
sick require, were well known by Agatha and her aids.
They always followed the army; no risk or toil was
shunned by them upon their noble mission. They were
the wards of the nation, and the favorites of the army.
Moreover, for why should we keep it a secret? every
one of them was dearly beloved by a worthy youth, who
had the joy of being loved in return.</p>

<p>The four Nurses made the round of the Hospital,
visited every couch, and applied or ordered needed
remedies. At the end of the
tent was a group of Brownies,
with wounds which required treatment,
but were not serious enough
to hinder from duty. Their hurts
were quickly cared for, and one
after another the party dropped
out until only one was left. He
was a tall, shapely youth, who
stood within the shadow of the
gangway with his face muffled in
a cloak. As the last of the group was dismissed from
the Nurses' hands he stepped forward into the light,
dropped his cloak, saluted the Nurses, and advancing to
Sophia's side held out toward her his left arm. The
sleeve had been ripped up, and a blood-stained bandage
surrounded the forearm. Sophia's cheeks grew pale,
and she uttered a low cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Why, Sophie," exclaimed the youth, "what has
possessed you? One would think you had never seen
blood before. Come, my good lass, it is only a scratch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and a few drops of your Lily Balm will make it all
right."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 41.&mdash;Sophia Dressing Sergeant True&#39;s Wounded Arm.</span>
</div>

<p>Sophia now found voice. "What a fright you gave
me! Are you sure that you are not badly hurt, True?
Quick! let me undo the bandage." The blood came
back to her cheeks which now were hot and flushed.
Her fingers trembled as she clipped the bandages with
the scissors that hung at her belt, bathed the wound,
and tenderly laid on lint and balm. Sophia was one of
the best and most impartial of nurses; but it must be
confessed that her fingers passed more gently over that
swollen arm; that her eyes had a more pitiful look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that hurt; that she lingered longer about the details of
bathing, anointing and bandaging that wound than she
had done in any other case. Do you blame her?</p>

<p>And Sergeant True was a model patient. Indeed he
seemed quite to enjoy his wound, or at least the treatment
of it. Agatha, after a few kind inquiries, had
busied herself in giving instructions to the ward nurses
and watchers. Faith and Grace had withdrawn to their
own tent.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came to me, True," said Sophia as
the last stitch was taken in the bands, and the sleeve was
being gently fastened to its place.</p>

<p>"Didn't I wait, just to make sure of that?" answered
the Sergeant. "Why, it is almost worth while to get a
scratch like this for the pleasure of having you doctor
it with those canny fingers of yours. Many thanks!"</p>

<p>"But I don't care to practice my art on you, remember!
Good bye!"</p>

<p>The words were spoken in the gangway as the handsome
Sergeant passed out, and&mdash;though it is by no
means certain,&mdash;something very like the sound of a kiss
followed close upon them.</p>

<p>"Good bye!"</p>

<p>Ah, how many times the words are uttered on the
border of shadows that shall pall loving hearts. It is
well that good-byes can be said in happy ignorance of
the morrow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="chapname">NIGHT WATCHES.</p>


<p>The four Brownie maidens were once more together
in their own quarters. There was little said for a long
time. The meeting between Sophia and her lover had
awakened tender and anxious thoughts in the hearts of
all. Agatha was following in imagination the agile
form of Lieutenant MacWhirlie, as he went the grand
rounds of his pickets. The thoughts of Faith were
with Adjutant Blythe who, somewhere in camp or field,
served at the Captain's side, his faithful squire and
counsellor. Grace's musings were of the gallant and
stalwart Ensign of the Corps, Sergeant Lawe.</p>

<p>It would be too much to say that the Nurses had no
anxiety about the safety of their lovers. But then,
they had been bred in the midst of war's alarms.
They knew that their fathers, kindred, and friends were
brave, experienced, skillful, and devoted to one another.
They had learned to regard war risks as matters of
ordinary life and business, and were rarely troubled
about them. There was special reason why they should
be even more light hearted than usual that night. Yet,
so strangely run the currents of one's thoughts, that
these maidens were all sad.</p>

<p>There was some reason, indeed, why Agatha and
Faith should feel thus, for the old saying fell true in
their case about the course of true love not running
smooth. Captain Bruce refused consent to the marriage
of Agatha and MacWhirlie. The two had waited
long, patiently, devotedly; yes, and hopefully, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
they had often known that "hope deferred" which
"maketh the heart sick." Every one thought the Captain's
conduct strange. But he never gave any reason,
except that Agatha was too grave, and MacWhirlie too
gay for a well balanced marriage. As obedience to
parents is one of the unchanging laws of Brownieland,
no one could oppose.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that Commodore Rodney had
taken up a like notion concerning his daughter and
Adjutant Blythe. "Blythe is too jovial, and Faith is
too serious," said the Commodore. "They could never
sail smoothly in the same ship on a whole life's course."
An odd feature of this trouble was that each of the
fathers pooh-hooed the objection of the other, and each
uncle was highly pleased with his niece's choice! The
best of Brownies, like other people, have their whimsies.
Grace and Sophia had no such sorrows to vex them,
and were looking forward to their wedding on the next
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Enough for the present of these disappointments and
hopes. The night watch in the Hospital has just been
changed, as have also the outer sentinels. Blythe, for
it is he who attends to this latter duty, has sounded a
soft note on the whistle that hangs against the rear door
of the Sanitary Tent. It is the signal that the Nurses
are wanted in the Hospital. Night duty is divided
between them, two of them always watching in the
Hospital, while the others sleep in the marquée. Agatha
and Grace have the first watch to-night, and pass into
the Hospital. But Faith knows whose lips had sounded
the call, and comes in to exchange a few words with
her lover.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Why should she, too, have come back with a tear
upon her cheek?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The light is turned down low in the fox-fire lantern.
The yellow hospital flag flaps lazily against the staff.
The full moon hangs over Hillside. The tramp, tramp
of the sentinel grows dim and clear by turns as he
recedes from or nears the door. The noises of the camp
have died away and silence reigns at last over plain, fort
and field. Both Brownies and Pixies are weary with
the day's battling and sleep well. Faith and Sophia,
too, after a long talk about their trials and their loves,
their hopes, fears and joys, have fallen asleep in each
other's arms.</p>

<p>The stars that mark the midnight hour are fast hastening
into the zenith. The sentinels walk their beats
with weary pace. The relief guards will soon be on the
rounds. Faith and Sophia stir in their sleep uneasily
as though dimly conscious that the whistle will soon call
them to duty. There is a soft touch, as the touch of an
angel's finger, upon their cheeks. It seems to rest upon
their eyes, their lips. It is pressed against their nostrils.
It stays their breathing. They turn restlessly on their
couch. They toss their arms, but the soft touch is on
them, too. Cannot they awake?</p>

<p>Yes, their eyes are open now. Is it a dream? Is it the
vision of a nightmare? Two forms, the terrible forms
of their foes, the Pixies, are bending over them, wrapping
them around in the silken folds of their snares!</p>

<p>Alas! it is no dream. The most dreaded of all their
enemies, Spite the Spy, chief of the Pixies, and Hide
the son of Shame, are crouching at their bedside. The
maidens start from their pillows, but fall back again
hopeless. They are bound hand and foot as with grave-clothes.
They are wrapped in a winding sheet of gossamer;
enshrouded alive.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Spite reckoned truly that the next impulse of the
Nurses would be to scream. He thrust his hairy face
close against their cheeks, and hissed from between his
lips, "Utter one sound and you die! Keep still and
you shall not be harmed."</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 42.&mdash;Spite and Hide Carry off the Nurses.</span>
</div>

<p>Sophia swooned quite away. Faith closed her eyes
and waited in an agony of fear. She felt Spite's strong
arms placed around her. She
was lifted from her couch;
was borne through the tent.
She was in
the open air,
and the
breeze blowing
upon
her cheeks
revived her. She opened her eyes. In the clear moonlight
she could see Hide pushing through the side of
the covered gangway, close by the rear door of the
marquée, carrying Sophia in his arms. With an instinct
of hope that no terror could check she lifted her voice
and screamed with the energy of despair. She felt the
Pixie's hot breath upon her cheek; an awful oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sounded in her ear, and a rude hand smote upon her
mouth. She fell back unconscious.</p>

<p>Let us follow backward the thread of our story into
the Pixie's camp where we left Spite keeping his solitary
watch, that we may account for this sudden appearance
in the heart of the Brownie encampment. Spite could
not sleep. Anger, mortification, hate, disappointed ambition,
all the evil passions were ablaze within him, as
he thought of what the Brownies had already gained,
and of their assured victory on the morrow. His troops
discouraged, provisions cut off, Madam Breeze (for aught
he knew) ready to side again with the Brownies,&mdash;his
utter defeat, the loss of the fort, and the massacre of
his people seemed certain.</p>

<p>"If we could abandon the fort," he muttered; "if
we could quietly steal out and leave the enemy watching
an empty camp? That would be our salvation! But
we can't; those troopers of MacWhirlie's are patrolling
the plain, and the woods in the rear are swarming with
pickets. But&mdash;I don't know?&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, crossed over to Hide's quarters
in Fort Tegenaria, bade him join him, and walked hastily
to the line of breastworks on the lake front. He stopped
under a bush that stood within the entrenchment. The
night was cloudless, and by the moonlight streaming
through the leaves, the two Pixies saw stretched among
the upper branches a round, vertical web. It was the
inner abutment of a bridge that once extended from
Fort Spinder to Lakeside, but had been long in disuse.</p>

<p>"Do you know the condition of the Old Bridge?"
asked Spite. "It has been a long time since I crossed it."</p>

<p>"I know little, except that I have heard some of my
boys say that the piers on this end are in pretty good
condition, and that some of the cables are still up."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 43.&mdash;"A Round, Vertical Web"&mdash;p. 86.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," said Spite, after musing a few moments,
"let us explore a little. You always used to be ready
for a scout, Hide, and I suppose have not forgotten your
old cunning. The Brownie sentinels are just beyond us,
there. Yon big fellow's beat runs under the middle of
the second span."</p>

<p>Hide was quite as ready for the adventure as Spite.
Without more words the two swung themselves into the
bushes, climbed up the sides of the abutment wall, and
were presently at the top.</p>

<p>"Here are the cables, at any rate," said Hide. "Only
two of them, however. The rest are broken off. They
hang down the sides of the abutment, and over the ends
of the branches."</p>

<p>"Pull on the one next you," cried Spite, who had
himself laid hold of one of the sound cables, and was
pushing down upon it with all his might. "Mine holds.
It is fast to the second pier in yonder bush, I am sure.
How with yours?"</p>

<p>"It is all right," answered Hide, "I am willing to
venture on it."</p>

<p>Nearly fifteen hundred millimetres distant was another
and taller bush in which pier No. 1 of the bridge was
built. The Pixies could not see this since the darkness
of the night and the shadow of the leaves hid the white
outlines of the web-wall. But they knew that it must
be there, and therefore crept upon the silken ropes each
upon one, and began their journey.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a></p>

<p>Three thousand millimetres above the ground, for the
whole distance from bush to bush over that single coil of
rope those two creatures crawled. The cables shook,
swayed and bent down, but neither parted, and the adventurous
Pixies landed safely on top of the pier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 264px;"><a name="Fig_44" id="Fig_44"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 44.&mdash;A Cobweb Bridge Across a Path.</span>
</div>

<p>The next pier was in a clump of bushes thirty-five
hundred millimetres away, not in a direct course, but
angling slightly across the field. The architects of the
Old Bridge had taken advantage of the brushwood
between the hill
and lake. But as
the shrubs grew at
irregular distances
from each other,
and in various lines
of direction, the
course of the bridge
was somewhat
broken from the
right line. Only
one cable remained
of those that had
united pier No. 1
and pier No. 2.
The scouts must
therefore cross
singly. To add to
the danger a
Brownie sentinel
was stationed
underneath the
cable, about midway
between the
piers.</p>

<p>"What say you,
Hide?" asked
the chief, "shall we go on?"</p>

<p>"What have you to gain by it, Cap'n? That's the
question with me. Tell me what you intend by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
exploring this old suspension bridge, and I'll say whether
it seems worth the risk."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Spite. "My plan is to repair these
cables by bracing the old ones, and putting up new ones,
so that we can abandon the fort secretly, if we are
pressed too hard. We could pass the whole force across
the bridge by night, embark in our vessels, and cross the
lake to the other shore, or to the island. The point I
want to settle is, whether the cables are so far good that
we can make a good roadway in the time at our command.
We must do night work, repairing as well as
crossing; and if we are hard pushed by the Brownies,
we shall have to do some rapid engineering. That's the
plan; what say you?"</p>

<p>"Good," cried Hide, "very good! It will be a fine
stroke to slip away and leave the enemy to watch bare
walls. Ha, ha! I fancy I see their solemn faces, on the
discovery of our flight." Hide grew quite merry over
his conceit.</p>

<p>"Very well then, that settles it. Here goes!" So
saying, Spite stepped upon the single cable and began
the passage. He moved slowly at first, until he found
that the line was strong enough to bear him; then he
increased his gait, and soon landed upon the top of pier
No. 2.</p>

<p>Hide perceived that Spite had reached the pier, for the
cable had ceased to vibrate under his movement, and
accordingly began his voyage. Midway between piers
he saw the Brownie sentinel approach. He passed underneath
the cable humming some pretty ditty as he
paced his beat.</p>

<p>Overhead just above him hung the black form of the
Pixie. Hide paused and peered downward upon the
unconscious Brownie. His eyes swelled with hate; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
breath escaped with a hissing sound, he bowed his back
in readiness to spring down upon the sentinel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="i45">
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 45.<br />
Unseen Dangers. Pixie Hide<br />
Threatens the Brownie Sentinel.</span>
</div></div>

<p>"Fool!" he muttered at last, "would you risk the
discovery of all for the sake of one miserable Brownie
more or less in the world? Ha! it was a great temptation;
and I was mighty near yielding to it. Might have
broken my neck, too! I don't know, though;" and he followed
the sentinel's retreating form with gloating eyes;
"I believe I could have dropped right down upon the
rascal, and throttled him ere he could have piped a
note. I'm sorry now that I didn't do it! But, no
matter; I'll get him some other time."</p>

<p>The sentinel, meanwhile, with steady gait passed onward
under the cable and out of sight behind the bushes.
He never knew how nearly he had escaped death that
night, nor even suspected that peril threatened him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Hide hurried over the remainder of the cable, and joined
his comrade on the pier.</p>

<p>"Well," whispered Spite, "my heart was beating a
tattoo of terror lest you might be rash enough to pounce
upon that fellow. Really, I expected to see you take
the leap. It was lucky that you controlled yourself. It
would uncover all were we to start the Brownies' suspicions
in this direction. We must keep all quiet on this
side the fort. Now for the next pier! How does it look
on your side?"</p>

<p>"There are a half dozen perfect lines here."</p>

<p>"Good. There are three here in prime order. Where
is the next pier?"</p>

<p>"Over in that oak sapling to the right. The span is
the longest in the bridge, about five thousand millimetres."</p>

<p>"Jolly, jolly!" exclaimed Spite in great glee. "We
are now sure of most of the way. This long span needs
little repairing. The first two we can fix up, I am quite
sure. Now for the last."</p>

<p>They were not long in running across the third span;
but when they reached pier No. 3, they found no traces
of the cables which once united it to the lakeside abutment.</p>

<p>"Bad!" said the Pixie chief. "It will have to be
built anew, that's all. It's lucky, too, that the worst
break is on the last span, for we can repair here with
less risk than elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Moreover," said Hide, "we have a double chance
for escape, the river as well as the bridge."</p>

<p>"True; and now let us finish our observation by finding
out the condition of yonder abutment." The pair
descended to the ground, crossed to the willow in which
the last pier had been fixed, and found it in quite as
good repair as the others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!" exclaimed Hide.</p>

<p>Spite said "Jolly!" one of his favorite slang expletives,
which he thought particularly good since he had
lately borrowed it from one of his English cousins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 46.&mdash;Spite and Hide View the Brownie Camp.</span>
</div>

<p>Highly pleased with what they had learned, the Pixies
turned their faces homeward. As they crossed the space
between the shore and pier No. 4, they had full view of
the Brownie encampment from a vine covered old stump.
There the line of cavalry
guards stretched along the
plain, encircling the fort.
Beyond, the camp fires of
the main army glimmered
amid the grass, weeds and
bushes. A profound silence
hung over the whole
scene. Both camp and fort were locked in the deep
repose of midnight.</p>

<p>"Captain!" said Hide. He stopped and looked
steadfastly toward the camp.</p>

<p>"Say on, comrade."</p>

<p>"I followed your venture," continued Hide, "will
you risk mine?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"That depends," answered the chief. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Just to make a private visit to the headquarters
yonder and pay our respects to the Brownie Captain.
We are now inside the picket line. We can make a
circuit around here by the lake and come up in the rear
of the tents. The sentinels will not be numerous there,
nor very watchful. It's a chance if there are any at all.
There is little risk in the matter, just enough to give it
spice. And&mdash;who knows? there might be a chance to
end the campaign by putting my dagger into Murray
Bruce's heart; or, failing that, you might bag that little
fairy flame of yours, and carry her off to the fort. That
would be 'jolly' indeed! Come, what say you?"</p>

<p>Spite hesitated. The plan seemed plausible. Hide
was a prudent fellow, and not apt to take unusual risks.
But then, there <i>was</i> the risk that he and his second in
command might be taken, or cut off. And what would
become of the Pixie cause in that case? It was not a
prudent act. But then, again, it was a strong temptation.
Assassinate Bruce? or, seize Faith?</p>

<p>"Lead on," he cried, "I'm with you."</p>

<p>The yellow flags of the hospital and sanitary tent
were their guide. Hide's theory about the sentinels they
found correct. They stole through the camp, passed the
rear of the hospital, and paused before the marquée of
the Sanitary Corps, which they took to be the officers'
headquarters. A peep through the flap of the tent
showed them their mistake, and revealed the sleeping
forms of Faith and Sophia.</p>

<p>"We stop here!" said Spite, pushing aside the door.
What followed has been told.</p>

<p class="chapname">THE GOLDEN MOTTOES.</p>


<p>Faith's cry breaking upon the midnight stillness was
heard throughout the camp. The wounded in the hospital
started up in their beds. The attendants ran
toward Agatha and Grace supposing that the cry came
from one of them. The two Nurses stood holding each
other fast, trembling violently, their eyes fixed upon the
door. Bruce ran from the headquarters tent, sword in
hand, followed by Blythe, Rodney and Pipe. There
was no need to sound the alarm, for the Brownies
were running from all parts of the camp to headquarters.</p>

<p>"What is it? A night attack?" Nobody knew.
"What was it&mdash;that terrible cry?" Nobody knew
that. The sentinels had seen nothing. Then came
MacWhirlie riding into the camp at full speed on one
of the Goldentailed matches, which Madam Breeze had
presented him.</p>

<p>Some one exclaimed: "Hah! this explains it! The
picket line has been attacked by the Pixies. The Lieutenant
has come for help."</p>

<p>No! He too had heard the cry, and had come to
learn the cause. All was quiet along the plain.</p>

<p>Leaving the perplexed throng outside, let us re-enter
the hospital. Agatha and Grace had recovered from
their fright. The excitement caused by the alarm, the
sudden and violent action of the soldiers in starting up
upon their couches, even leaping from them, had reopened
many wounds so that they were bleeding freely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Some of the worst cases had fallen back fainting. All
was confusion within the place. The helpers were hurrying
hither and thither. From the outside the Brownies
were running in and out with the pointless questions
usual in times of
panic. Agatha's
heart was touched
at the sight. The
voice of pity
within her at once
mustered her disordered
faculties.</p>

<p>"Grace, Grace,"
she cried, "this

Hasten to the marquée

Sophia come to the aid of
these poor fellows. Quick!
and bring all the lint that
you can find. Guards!" she
continued, calling to the sentinels
at the doors, "keep out the people.
We must have quiet here. Howard,"
addressing the head helper, "look to
your aids! Brothers," she spoke to all
attendants now, "remember your Golden
Mottoes!"</p>

<p>She pointed as she spoke to the eastern
side of the tent, sweeping her hand along
the line of wall. Silk banners hung thereon, upon
every one of which a Golden Motto was embroidered,
together with various emblems, designs and tracery.
Rich effects were produced by using the many hued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
scales on the wings of butterflies, the brilliant shells
and elytra of beetles, and minute feathers of humming
birds, which were embossed upon the cloth with silk
raveled from cocoons of moths and spiders.<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> The banners
were the gift
of the Sanitary
Corps whose cunning
fingers had
made them. Let us
follow the rapid motion
of Agatha's
hand and read these
Golden Mottoes.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48.&mdash;A Spider&#39;s Cocoon Nest.</span>
</div>

<p>The design of
Banner One is, on
a blue shield, a carrier
pigeon in full
flight, with a message
tied by a ribbon
about its neck. In
the surrounding border
are grouped and
interwoven arrows
and other emblems
of speed and promptness.
The motto is:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">QUICKLY DONE IS TWICE DONE.</span></p>

<p>The design of
Banner Two is, on a
blue shield, a silver
pyramid, the North Star shining above it. In the border
are wrought figures of a frontiersman with his rifle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
hand standing
among rocks and
great oaks; a pilot
at his wheel; an Indian
shooting rapids in his bark
canoe; a whaleman at the
bow of his boat with harpoon
poised. The legend is:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">COOL HEAD GIVES HELPFUL HANDS.</span></p>

<p>The design of Banner Three
is, on a red shield, a full orbed
golden sun with the old fashioned
cheerful human face wrought
upon it, and bright rays shooting
out in all directions. In the
border are anchors, flowers, song
birds, sporting Brownies, winsome
figures and emblems.
The motto is:</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 49.&mdash;The Brownies&#39; Banners and Golden Mottoes.</span>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">CHEERFULNESS IS BOTH BALM AND BROTH.</span></p>

<p>Banner Four, although
not the most beautiful in
point of imagery, is the
most costly, the most
carefully wrought and
the most striking of all.
On a purple shield two
points, one above
the other, one in
chief and one in
base are represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
by golden stars, and these are united by a straight
line. The motto is:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">OUR LIFE LINE A RIGHT LINE.</span></p>

<p>The border consists of various mathematical instruments,
a rule, square, dividers, sailor's compass, etc., and
running all around the banner through these are the
sentences "Straightway From Knowledge to Duty,"
"Duty First, Duty Last."</p>

<p>It has taken some time to note these decorations, but
only a moment was consumed by the glance that Agatha
and her aids cast upon them. That glance and the voice
of their fair leader acted like a charm. The words had
scarcely been uttered before the helpers were scattered
through the tents and at the couches of the suffering.
Agatha herself kneeled beside a wounded soldier, rearranged
the bandages, and poured in fresh balm. She
had cast more than one impatient look toward the side
door that led into the Sanitary tent, wondering why Grace
had not already come back with Faith and Sophia.</p>

<p>The rear door of the hospital, near which Agatha
was kneeling, was pushed violently forward and Grace
entered. She was capless, her hair streamed over her
shoulders, her whole appearance showed anguish and
agitation.</p>

<p>"They are gone!" she cried. Agatha rose hastily
and threw herself into her arms.</p>

<p>"Gone? who? Faith? Sophia? Gone!&mdash;where?
Speak, girl, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot tell. Something dreadful has happened.
They were not in the room when I went in. I supposed
they had gone out to learn what was the trouble, and
ran into the crowd to seek them. Nobody knew. Your
father and uncle, and Pipe, and all the rest were there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
but no Faith&mdash;no Sophia. They knew nothing of them.
They are searching for them now. They fear that the
Pixies have carried them off. Oh, Agatha! what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>Ah, Agatha, do you remember the Golden Mottoes
now! Will she remember, think you? Her frame
shook with emotion; her hands were cold; beads of
moisture gathered on her pale forehead. She spoke in a
dreamy way, as though talking to herself: "Carried off
by the Pixies? Gone? Cousin Faith gone? Sophia
gone?"</p>

<p>Then she started as from a trance. There was a
tremor in her voice, but she spoke quietly, as one who
had struggled with her own heart and got the victory.</p>

<p>"Grace, God help them! But our duty lies here.
There is no time now for grief. There is no call on us
to take part in the work and peril of delivering our
sister Nurses. Others will do it better than we. Our
duty is plain. And is just before us. Mine is here.
Grace, dear, yours is there!"</p>

<p>She pointed first to the couch at which she had been
kneeling, then to one across the aisle, and quietly turning
from her companion, knelt down again by the
wounded Brownie, and took up the dropped thread of
her labor of love. When she lifted her eyes Grace was
at her post. Noble conquerors! These are the victories
of those who be better than they who take a city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="chapname">ON THE TRAIL.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, the light of fox-fire and fire-fly lanterns
was glancing everywhere through camp and field, showing
where eager searchers were scattered looking for the
lost Nurses. Rodney was well nigh frantic with grief,
and ran here and there among the tents calling the name
of his daughter. Only the echo of his voice came back
to him out of the night. Pipe was as one paralyzed.
He leaned against the wall of the tent with folded arms,
and eyes fixed upon the spot where his child had lain.
His mute sorrow was pitiful to see.</p>

<p>Blythe and Sergeant True entered the tent. The
Adjutant's bright face was clouded; the tall form of the
Sergeant was bowed.</p>

<p>"If one only knew!" said Blythe. "It is this terrible
uncertainty that is so hard to bear. If I knew
where they were, I could cut my way through legions
of fiends to save them, or die trying."</p>

<p>"Is there no trace at all?" asked True.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. It is only a suspicion"&mdash;he
lowered his voice&mdash;"that they have been carried off by
the Pixies. No one dares even name it to the Commodore
and&mdash;" nodding toward the Boatswain.</p>

<p>"But that is not reason," answered True. "It is
important that we should know the worst, at once. For
one, I mean to find out the truth, if I can, and face it
manfully."</p>

<p>He stepped to the couch, which lay just as it had
been left by the Nurses. His hand caught upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
thread of gossamer that lay upon a pillow. He looked
more closely. There was another, then another, then
a thick strand of the silken material. He rose with the
delicate filaments floating from his fingers, walked to
the lantern, and held
his hand within the
light. Blythe followed
every motion.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/fig_050.jpg" width="203" height="350" alt="Fig. 50.&mdash;A Brownie Link Boy with a Fire-fly Lantern." title="Fig. 50.&mdash;A Brownie Link Boy with a Fire-fly Lantern." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 50.&mdash;A Brownie Link Boy
with a Fire-fly Lantern.</span>
</div>

<p>"Do you see?" cried
True. "There can be
no doubt of it. Some
of the enemy have
passed the lines, entered
this tent, woven
their snares around the
sleeping maids, and escaped.
One of the two
Nurses uttered that cry
as they were being carried
off. We must
look for them in the
Pixies' fort or on the
way to it."</p>

<p>"That is truth," said
Blythe, "and the sooner
we begin the search the better."</p>

<p>True walked up to Pipe and touched him tenderly
upon the shoulder. The Boatswain looked up vacantly.</p>

<p>"Ah, my lad, it is you!" he said at last. "Where
is our Sophia?"</p>

<p>"Boatswain," said True, holding up the hand to which
the gossamer threads were still clinging, "Sophia is in
the Pixies' fort or on the way to it. And you and I must
bring her back. Come, rouse up! Be yourself again!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Pipe started from his lethargy. He looked at the
floating strand of web-work; listened to True's statement;
passed his palm against his brow, then seized the
Sergeant's hand.</p>

<p>"My boy, you are right! And I have been acting
the fool! Poor girl! poor girl! Come&mdash;let us not delay.
To the Pixies' fort! Ho, my brave tars!" Even while
he spoke Pipe stepped to the door of the tent and put
his whistle to his lips.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" cried True, laying a hand upon his
arm. "Remember the proverb: Make haste slowly!
Are we sure that our lost ones are at the fort yet?
May we not find some other traces of them that will
enable us to go to work more intelligently? Don't call
your men. They are scattered abroad in busy search.
They are doing no harm, and may do much good. Let
them alone for the present. You and I can follow this
trail a little further."</p>

<p>There was a cool head at last on the track of the
fugitives. The fact gave at least a glimmer of hope.
True first inquired carefully of Agatha, Grace and others
in the hospital, as to the exact point from which the
shriek had come. They all agreed that it had been
made close by the rear of the tent, so near that it seemed
to be inside.</p>

<p>"That determines our first step," said True. "Now
for lanterns and the sharpest eyes among you. We
shall search here," he continued, and led the party just
outside the tent, and set them to scanning every bush,
grass blade and weed in the vicinity. The Nurses had
been asked to join the search for a little while, and fortune
gave to Agatha the first important discovery.</p>

<p>"Here!" she cried, "I have a trace!" She had
plucked from a thistle stalk a bit of gossamer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I too!" cried Pipe, holding up a similar object.</p>

<p>"And I!" said Grace, who was in advance of the
party.</p>

<p>"Stop!" exclaimed True. "Stand where you are
until I get the line of the trail."</p>

<p>Agatha stood nearest the tent. Pipe was beyond
her and a little to the right. Grace stood some distance
from
both
in a
direct line with Agatha.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_051.jpg" width="400" height="384" alt="Fig. 51.&mdash;&quot;From a Thistle Stalk a Bit of Gossamer.&quot;" title="Fig. 51.&mdash;&quot;From a Thistle Stalk a Bit of Gossamer.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 51.&mdash;&quot;From a Thistle Stalk a Bit of Gossamer.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That will do," said True,
glancing up at the North Star.
"The line runs due north,
and straight from the rear
of the camp. Start again
while I make some inquiries
of the Adjutant. Blythe, a
word with you. Who was
on guard over there, to the
north?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Blythe, you
couldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" exclaimed Blythe,
his voice choking with emotion. "The Captain bade it.
And Rodney, and Pipe,&mdash;and myself, alas, alas! we all
councilled it. The men were weary. A strong picket
line entirely surrounded the fort. They were picked
men with MacWhirlie at their head. We knew that
no force of the enemy lay in our rear. No one dreamed
of danger from that quarter."</p>

<p>"Say no more," said True. "Regrets are useless now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
I see how it is. A party of stragglers or spies has
stolen in here while we slept. Faith and Sophia have
been surprised while alone in the tent."</p>

<p>"But what motive?&mdash;" began Blythe. A shout from
the searchers interrupted him. It was Pipe's voice.</p>

<p>"We have struck the trail again!"</p>

<p>"Who has it?"</p>

<p>"Howard there, and myself."</p>

<p>"Steady! let me see. Here are our first traces,
where those three lanterns hang. Hold up your lights
to the points where you found the last signs. That will
do. There, do you see? Two of the first lanterns are
in line with Howard's light, the other in line with Pipe's.
And the two lines are nearly parallel, showing the paths
by which the two maids were borne away. We are on
the trail. Due north still! Forward, once more!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_052.jpg" width="300" height="129" alt="Fig. 52.&mdash;&quot;A Bit of Gossamer.&quot;" title="Fig. 52.&mdash;&quot;A Bit of Gossamer.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 52.&mdash;&quot;A Bit of Gossamer.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Step by step the trail was followed by threads caught
here and there upon leaves and branches. It continued
to bear northward for a goodly distance, then turned
westward as though the fugitives were making gradually
toward the fort. There it was lost for a while, and when,
discovered again was once more bearing north. Again
it turned westward, and was lost completely in the plain
that encircled the fort, just where it bordered on a
strip of sand that ran down to the little lake.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">THE LOST TRAIL.</p>


<p>Sergeant True stood on the edge of the plain considering
what should next be done. All signs of the
trail had ceased as soon as the searchers had come out
of the grass and brushwood. There could be no trail
upon the flat plain, the Sergeant knew. A large party
had just returned from searching the wood between the
lake and the fort. There was a bare possibility that the
fugitives had ventured to cross the plain, and run the
gauntlet of the picket line into the fort; a little stronger
possibility that they had skirted the wood by the shore
and pushed on down toward the outlet where the Pixie
navy lay. True therefore questioned the returning
searchers:</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Lieutenant MacWhirlie has had the
entire strip between lake and fort thoroughly guarded
ever since the alarm. Nothing could have passed, he
says. Nothing has passed that has left any trail. The
Lieutenant has sent scouts down the shore to make
sure."</p>

<p>Rodney and Pipe heard the report with heavy hearts.
Hope was fast dying within them. "Must we give it
up?" cried the Commodore. "Is there no deliverance?"</p>

<p>"There is but one way by which they could have
escaped us," said True, pointing toward the lake. "Is
it possible that we have been mistaken, and that pirates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have done this outrage after all? Commodore, have
there been any boats or ships off shore lately?"</p>

<p>"Not one," answered Rodney. "Both fleets are
lying by for repairs, for the last fight used them up pretty
well. We've been doing shore service ever since."</p>

<p>"It is most strange! But we must search the shore
thoroughly in this neighborhood, at any rate."</p>

<p>The bank of the lake was presently covered with
Brownies eagerly scanning by the light of their torches
and lanterns every foot of ground.</p>

<p>"We have it, we have it!" shouted Rodney. "Come
here, Pipe! and you, Waterborn. Look at this!"
Immediately a crowd surrounded the excited Commodore.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" he cried; "don't push down so close
upon the shore until some of the sailors have seen these
marks. A boat has landed here within the last half
hour. See the wash of the waves upon the sand! And
just there the bow has scraped. What say you, lads?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it," responded Pipe, after a
careful examination. Waterborn, the mate, held his lantern
to the water line and after a moment's inspection
gave the same opinion.</p>

<p>"Here," exclaimed Blythe, "is the crowning proof!"
He plucked from the shore a handful of silken threads
that had caught upon the sand and gravel which covered
the spot where Faith and Sophia must have lain. Yes,
they had found the trail again; but only to lose it in the
waters of Lake Katrine.</p>

<p>"What shall be done?" asked Rodney.</p>

<p>"We must follow you now," answered True. "The
path lies upon an element of which I know little. You
and the Boatswain are at home there. To you who are
most wronged Providence gives the opportunity to undo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the injury. We yield to the navy, now. Lead on; we'll
follow you, you may be sure."</p>

<p>Rodney and Pipe had scarcely been themselves since
the first tidings of their bereavement. Their wills seemed
benumbed by the blow. They followed Sergeant True
like little children. But now that responsibility was laid
in their hands, they roused themselves to duty. They
were the keen, shrewd, sailor chiefs once more. Subdued
still by their grief, but alert and intelligent, they took
up the work before them.</p>

<p>"'Tis an element that leaves no trail," said Rodney,
"yet it will go hard, but my gallant tars shall find the
lost ones. We'll scour every nook and beat every bush
along shore, if need be. We'll pluck the dear captives
from under the black flag or we'll sink every timber in
the fleet! What say you, lads?"</p>

<p>A hearty cheer was the sailors' answer. The whole
company on shore joined in it. And it did them all
good.</p>

<p>"You can not tell which direction the boat has taken,
of course," said True. "But have you any opinion at
all about it? You must start out from some view point.
What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I have been asking myself,"
said Rodney. "I have a notion that the boat, wherever
it came from, has crossed to the island or gone down to
the outlet to join the fleet. I incline to the latter view.
The island is lightly garrisoned; the Orchard Camp is
nearly deserted; the mass of Pixie troops are shut up
in Fort Spinder. Naturally, the robbers would take to
the fleet as the safest place."</p>

<p>"That is good reasoning, Commodore," said Waterborn,
"and there is only one thing that weakens it.
The wind would be dead against them going downward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
For the last half hour it has been blowing due north&mdash;straight
upon the island."</p>

<p>"True; but we shall see presently. The first thing
is to rally our men. Boatswain, pipe to quarters."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir!" answered Pipe, and the shrill whistle
sounded through the air and along the water. A few
stragglers who had joined the various searching parties
gathered in at the call. But most of the sailors and
marines were already present.</p>

<p>"Now lads, we must away to our ships. Fall in!
Forward, march!" The column started up the shore at
quick step, and was soon lost to view.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">RAFT THE SMUGGLER.</p>


<p>Spite and Hide saw that Faith's cry had aroused the
Brownies, and pushed at their utmost speed directly from
the camp. It did not occur to them that they might be
tracked by the threads of web-work torn off by leaves
and twigs from the cords with which they had bound
their captives. But they did fear that one of the Nurses
might again cry out; and they stopped long enough to
fasten gags upon their mouths.</p>

<p>Several times the Pixie chiefs turned toward Fort
Spinder, hoping to reach the Old Bridge by the way they
had come. But their progress was checked by bands of
Brownies scattered everywhere in the direction of the
fort. The lights of the searchers were seen dancing
throughout the entire plain, and running hither and
thither in confused lines among grass and shrubbery.</p>

<p>More than once the Pixies were on the point of being
discovered. Several times they had to crouch under the
leaves, lest they should be seen by parties of excited
searchers. Indeed, their safety lay in the fact that the
Brownies were so much excited; and had all been as
self-possessed as the cool headed True, Spite and Hide
would have been captured.</p>

<p>At last they reached a point where the plain sweeps
down to the sandy bank of the lake, which is a natural
basin widened into an artificial pond. The brook that
flows from the Hillside spring runs through it. There
is an island in the middle of the lake, covered with grass,
moss and ferns. In honor of the old home the Brownies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
called the lake Loch Katrine, and the island Ellen's
Isle, names which the Pixies refused to acknowledge,
and called the pond Lake Arachne and the island
Aranea Isle. On this little sheet of water, and its inlet
and outlet, the navies of the Brownies and Pixies
floated; and here was the scene of many a battle between
Rodney and his sailors and the Pixies and pirates.</p>

<p>Spite and Hide paused on the border of the plain to
consider. It was not far to the pier of the Old Bridge
along which lay the path to the fort. But the space between
them and that point was swarming with Brownies.
MacWhirlie had mustered his entire troop, and set them
to patrolling the plain. Throughout the woods, from
the foot of the hill to the very lakeside, sentinels were
posted at short intervals, and burdened as they were the
Pixies could not pass that line.</p>

<p>"Well, Hide, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Do? Humph! there is little choice left us now. I
will follow my chief. Lead on!"</p>

<p>"Lead on? Whither?" Spite snapped his fangs angrily
as he spoke. "You got me into this scrape. It
was a foolhardy adventure. Now get me out! I know
you have something to advise."</p>

<p>"Very good! Let us kill these pretty captives of
ours," said Hide with a sneer, "and cut our way through
to the pier. Or, if you lead the way with them, I'll
follow."</p>

<p>Spite looked down upon the unconscious form of
Faith.</p>

<p>"I see no way out of this," he said. "To break
through the line would be certain death. It looks as
though it had come to that at any rate. May the foul
fiend take you for tempting me to this madcap raid!
Hide, Hide, bethink you, I pray!" Spite's voice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
trembling with&mdash;fear, shall we say? Without awaiting
reply from his companion, he took Faith in his arms
and ran down to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Hide followed him. He had long suspected what no
one else had dreamed of, that Spite at heart was a
coward. He had little love for his chief. Indeed, the
thought was not new to the ambitious Lieutenant that
Spite alone blocked the way of his own promotion to
the headship of the Pixies.
That he would be a worthy
leader he, at least, did not
doubt. He enjoyed his
Captain's agitation, and
was pleased to keep him
upon nettles. He had already
settled a plan of escape.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 53.&mdash;Brownie Fire-fly Lantern.</span>
</div>

<p>Spite eagerly scanned
the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>"It's no use looking for
the navy, Captain," said
Hide. "There it rides,
away down by the outlet.
We must pass the Brownie
pickets to get at the boats. Might as well cut through
to the pier!"</p>

<p>"Is there no escape then? This is terrible! We
shall be slaughtered outright." He pointed to the semi-circle
of lanterns and torches drawing closer and closer
upon them, marking where True and his party were
following hard upon their trail. Spite dropped his
burden, sat down, and fairly wrung his hands in despair.
Yes, Spite the Spy, the chief of all the Pixies, did
that!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Hide highly enjoyed the distress of his Captain. He
had proved what he had long suspected, and, best of all,
he had gained a hold upon Spite that would give great
advantage over him in the future. He saw that it was
high time to drop this malicious by play and address
himself in earnest to escape.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my brave Captain!" he cried, "I think I
see a way out of this."</p>

<p>"Hah! Is it so?" Spite was too much elated with
hope to notice the sneering tone of his Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"You shall see wait here a moment." He ran along
the sand to a clump of ferns that bent
over from the bank until
they kissed the water. He
mounted one of these and disappeared. Soon the drooping
tips of the ferns lifted up, parted, and a curious
craft glided out from the cove formed by the bended
foliage. What a snug and secret harbor it was! The
vessel touched the bank close by the spot where Spite
stood, and Hide jumped ashore.</p>

<p>"Now then," he cried, "all aboard! We have no
time to lose." He lifted Sophia from the ground as he
spoke, carried her to the boat and laid her down in a
leafy canopy or cabin. Spite followed with Faith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Push off now!" said Hide to a tall Pixie who had
charge of the vessel. He put his paws against the
shore and shoved vigorously. The waterman did the
same, and the boat shot out into the lake. A brisk
wind was blowing along the surface of the water, and
the craft was soon off shore and out of danger.</p>

<p>The lanterns of the Brownies were seen bobbing along
the bank just above the spot at which but a moment
before the boat had been moored. A group of lights
marked the point at which the trail had been lost, and
where True and his party were now standing perplexed.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Spite as he watched the scene. It was
hard to tell whether the sound betokened pleasure or
displeasure. He was greatly relieved at the prospect
of escape, but was not in the most amiable humor, for
all that. With the easing of his fears came the thought
of how he had exposed his weakness. His pride was
hurt. He felt humiliated. He knew that Hide had
been trifling with him, and his wrath grew hot thereat.
He vowed revenge in his heart, but was too wise to show
his feeling then. "I can wait!" he said. He glowered
upon the Lieutenant, but soon cleared up his face and
spoke cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Truly, friend Hide, you seem to be a person of
varied resources. Pray, how chanced you to come
across this waterman and his boat?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, Cap'n?" answered Hide laughing, "I
have to keep a little private yacht for my own use.
There are certain things, you know, for which one cannot
well use the government ships. This is my friend,
Raft Dolomede. Raft, allow me to present you to my
chief, Spite the Spy. You see, Captain, my American
friend has great respect for our community, although he
does not belong to us. He has been brought up on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
lake; is a skillful sailor, willing to obey orders, take his
pay and ask no questions. He runs on his own hook&mdash;is
a privateersman, in fact, on a small scale. We understand
each other pretty well, and, of course, I knew
where he kept his boat moored. He's not on very good
terms with our cruisers; for, in sooth, he doesn't quite
understand our revenue laws. I fear, now, that it
wouldn't do to look closely under these leaves! There
might be something contraband aboard besides these fair
Brownies. Hey, Raft?"</p>

<p>Raft's boat was a home-made affair, but was ingeniously
built. Dry leaves had been gathered into a mass,
and fastened together with silken threads. To this had
been added a mast, a sail, a jib and other fixtures so
that the structure was a cross between a raft and a
schooner. The leaves served admirably the varied uses
of hull, sails, storerooms, beds and barricade. They
caught the wind and drove the boat along as well as a
ship's canvas. They were soft dry couches for sailors
or passengers. The hollows and crevices between them
were the "hold" of the vessel and gave ample storage.</p>

<p>Raft, the owner of this craft, was a handsome specimen
of the family of water-pixies. He wore a coat of
chocolate brown, trimmed with a broad orange band,
and covered with double rows of white buttons. His
trousers were pale red. He was quite at home on the
lake with his yacht, and was such a skillful swimmer
that he might really be said to walk on the water instead
of swimming through it.<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a></p>

<p>"How shall I put her head now?" asked Raft. "We're
bearing nor' east by east, and with this wind will soon
strike the cave yonder on the orchard shore. Shall I
keep her so?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>"What say you, Captain?" asked Spite. "What
are we to do with these, now?" pointing to Faith and
Sophia.</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done, it seems to me," said Raft,
casting a pitying look upon the nurses, "is to give 'em
a little breathing privilege. If you don't take those
rags off their figure-heads, and give 'em a breath of fresh
wind, they'll soon be dead Brownies." With that he
opened the sharp claws on one of his hands, like a pair
of scissors, and without more ado cut the bands that had
been placed as gags around the captives' mouths.</p>

</div>

<p>"All right!" he
said, resuming his
rudder, "go on with
your palaver. But
heave ahead lively,
or we'll be across the
lake before you decide."</p>

<p>Spite had been in
a deep study. At
last he said, "We must go to the island."</p>

<p>Raft glanced inquiringly at Hide, who nodded assent.
"Aye, aye, Sir. Port-a-helm it is." He turned the bow
toward Ellen's Isle.</p>

<p>"We can easily find lodgings for our fair prizes there,"
continued Spite. "But what about Fort Spinder? That
is what troubles me. How are we to get back? It is
now too soon after the alarm to think of running the
pickets. Even if it were possible to do that by night
as things are now, it would be madness to try it by daylight.
And yet, we must get some word to our people
soon, and have them out of that fort by to-morrow
night, or&mdash;" Spite paused and looked serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?" said Raft.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Hide, "or&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"You know quite as well as I!" answered Spite.
"There will not be a corporal's guard of Pixies left in
Fort Spinder, that's all!"</p>

<p>Hide shrugged his shoulders and looked grave. He
had known very well what Spite meant, and he had a wife
and children in the fort. There was a long pause.
Spite and Hide were in deep and anxious thought.
They could imagine the wild natures shut up within
Fort Spinder venting their native savagery in murderous
assaults upon one another.<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> What could control them
when the absence of their two chief officers should be
discovered? Was there any chance for them to return
to the fort? or any other way to prevent the catastrophe
which they dreaded? The wind freshened, and in the
meantime the "Fringe" (as Raft called his yacht) was
rapidly approaching the island.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="chapname">A PALACE AND A PRISON.</p>


<p>Faith and Sophia were much relieved by Raft's considerate
act. They had never thought to be grateful to
a Pixie, but they felt gratitude toward the smuggler as
he cut the bands upon their mouths. Their limbs were
still bound, but they could turn upon their sides or backs,
and look into the quiet, starlit sky. Their minds were in
a whirl of wonder, uncertainty, terror. They had scarcely
taken in the full horror of their condition. Captives in
Pixies' hands!</p>

<p>Their hearts had beaten fast with fear when Raft
drew near, but the kind words and act of the bluff
sailor revived their hopes a little. Perhaps even the
Pixies might take pity upon them and restore them to
their home! At all events, it lessened their suffering to
be free to breathe naturally, and it was a comfort to be
able to talk together, instead of looking into each other's
faces in mute wretchedness. They were near the bow
and their captors were in the stern of the boat with
Raft; they could therefore speak freely in whispers
without fear of being heard. On the contrary, the three
Pixies spoke aloud, as though not caring to conceal their
thoughts from the prisoners, or not thinking they were
overheard. Thus, much of their conversation reached
the nurses' ears.</p>

<p>Spite and Hide sat thinking. Raft stood at the tiller
and kept the boat steady on its course. Not a sound
was heard except the ripple of water against the sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of the vessel as it moved rapidly onward through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Faith, dear Faith," whispered Sophia, "I cannot
make it all out. Where are we? What is to be done
with us? How came we here?"</p>

<p>"We are on Lake Katrine, Sophia, and we are sailing
toward Ellen's Isle in a Pixie yacht. That much I
am sure of. I know nothing more. But alas! I dread
the worst. What can we expect from our terrible foes?
And then the hatred they bear father and uncle&mdash;oh,
my poor, poor father!" The thought of their friends'
grief and anxiety for them awakened a fresh train of
anguish in the captives' hearts. They laid their heads
down upon the leaves and wept together.</p>

<p>Forsaken! Lost! The waves laughed and danced
merrily by them as the bow cut the water. The stars
looked down coldly from the great solemn heights of the
sky, and twinkled and winked upon them as though
careless or ignorant, or even in mockery of their fate!
Why had such a sorrow come upon them?</p>

<p>"Captain Spite," said Hide, at last.</p>

<p>"Well, Hide, what is it?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Oh Faith, do you hear that?" whispered Sophia.
"We are in the hands of Spite the Spy and his Lieutenant!
Heaven defend us now!"</p>

<p>Faith answered with a groan.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I have thought," said Hide, "that we might sell our
prisoners. If we keep them, they will be a world of
trouble and risk. Dispose of them, we get out of our
scrape handsomely, save the garrison and people in the
fort, get vast credit for valor and strategy, and start a
fresh campaign full handed, with good chance to regain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
our lost ground. I don't see any way out of this, but
to put up our fair prizes at ransom."</p>

<p>"Well," said Spite sharply, "go on!"</p>

<p>"Not much more to say, Cap'n. Let's go in, or send
Raft in with a flag of truce. Offer to give up the Nurses
if Bruce and the Commodore will raise the siege of Fort
Spinder. I believe they'll do it."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, that they will!" said Raft heartily. "It's
a sensible plan, and as manly as sensible; for, the fact
is, I don't relish this making war on women."</p>

<p>"Faugh! no cant, please!" sneered Spite. "Anything
with Brownie blood is our game. But you're
mistaken. Bruce and all the rest, that Sergeant True
particularly, would take the high moral grounds about
the business, and send back word: 'Better all die than
compromise Truth and Duty, or give up the pursuit of
wrong.' They wouldn't do what you expect. I doubt
if they would even receive our flag of truce."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The hearts of the prisoners fluttered between hope
and fear as they heard these words. Home again! The
very thought gave them joy.</p>

<p>"Faith, we shall be ransomed, I know!" exclaimed
Sophia.</p>

<p>Faith was silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, Faith, you don't believe they would do that?"
again whispered Sophia when Spite had ended. "Surely
your father would consent! and dear True also&mdash;" She
stopped and caught her breath quickly as though a cruel
doubt had suddenly seized her new fledged hope.</p>

<p>Faith was still silent.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Raft next spoke. "Well, that's amazing to me!
Now, I think if my gal was in the hands of two such&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
he paused as though at loss for a word. "Two such&mdash;accomplished
villains;" he continued, "I reckon you'll
think that complimentary, gentlemen;&mdash;I wouldn't stop
to split hairs very long, I can tell you. I like grit, too;
but I can't say that I admire it at the expense of those
pretty things over there."</p>

<p>"Captain," said Hide, "wouldn't Bruce compromise
by simply letting our folks retire from the fort unmolested?
March out with arms, banners, and all the
honors, and leave the Brownies to occupy the old shell,
and destroy it at their leisure? I say try it anyhow."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Raft. "That proposition ought to
double the cape of the sharpest scruple. Say you'll
land your cargo; hoist a flag of truce; and I'll run in
shore within hailing distance. Or, if you like it better,
I'll undertake the matter myself."</p>

<p>The Pixie chief made no answer. Faith and Sophia
listened to hear their fate pronounced, with feelings
wrought up to the highest pitch. Spite rose and walked
excitedly up and down the deck. He stopped and looked
at Faith. He seemed about to yield. He raised his
eyes to the water, then cast them upon the island which
was now just ahead of them. Then he stood like a
statue gazing at some object which hung in the air beyond
the bow of the yacht. A fiendish smile passed
over his face. For a long time he was silent and
motionless.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I'm much obliged for your
council. But I have a better way. Fort Spinder shall
be empty before to-morrow's sunrise, and its garrison and
contents safe on the orchard side of the lake in Big
Cave Camp. Patience! You shall know my plans as
soon as we have put our prisoners in a secure place."</p>

<p>He spoke like a new person. There was an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
confidence in his manner, and a jubilant ring in his
voice that gave assurance to his companions. They were
quite content to wait and trust the chief. Besides, the
boat was now touching shore. The bow grated upon the
sand. Raft jumped off and made the Fringe fast.</p>

<p>"Come now, my dears," said Spite, approaching the
Nurses, "we will go ashore and take things a little
easier."</p>

<p>Faith and Sophia were once more stricken with
despair. The hope of being ransomed had been dashed
by this mysterious plan which Spite had hinted to his
comrades. What it was they could not even conjecture;
but it meant imprisonment, death, it may be worse than
death to them in a Pixies' den. Resistance they knew
was vain. They could only plead for mercy. They
lifted up their voices together and with crying and tears
sought to move the pity of their captors.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Spite, "if you will behave yourselves
there shall not a hair of your head come to harm.
Bless your pretty faces, we don't mean to eat you.
Come, cheer up! We intend to take you to a snug and
comfortable house, a palace in fact. You never spied a
prettier place, I warrant. You shall be with friends
who will know how to take care of you. 'Pon honor,
you shall not be harmed. There now!"</p>

<p>With an effort at consolation which sat awkwardly
upon him, he cut loose the web-work shroud that enveloped
Faith, and without more ado picked her up and
jumped on shore. Hide followed with Sophia.</p>

<p>The two Pixies ran along shore a short distance, and
then began to ascend the bank. They stopped near a
tuft of grass on a mossy slope, where Spite laid down
his burden and began to examine carefully the surface.
A bunch of moss somewhat dried, and heaped up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
careless way, attracted his attention. "Here is our
place!" he exclaimed, and tapped against one side of
the heap. There was no response. He seized the moss
and shook it vigorously. Thereupon, one side of the
moundlet suddenly opened, pushing outward like a
door.</p>

<p>An old Pixie, large and gaunt, thrust out her head,
and cried, "What do you want? Begone, or I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no you won't, Mother Tigrina! Don't you
see? It's Spite, my good old lady. Open quickly!
There, that will do. Come on, Hide."</p>

<p>The officers entered, carrying Faith and Sophia. The
place in which the party now stood was a domed chamber
or vestibule, lined in all parts with white silk. The
tapestry was spread over the interior of the moss heap,
which was in fact a hollow ball built up by skillful workmanship,
although the rude exterior had the appearance
of a chance accumulation. At the outer end of this
mossy dome an oval portion had been left unattached to
sides and bottom, and was fastened at the top alone by
the silken lining. Thus was formed a rude sort of door,
hinged at the top, which the occupant could raise at will
or fasten by overspinning from the inside. This dome
was in fact a vestibule or outer approach of a deep cave
or tunnel, which slanted into the ground for a short distance
and then turned downward.<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> This cavern was
held by Spite as a sort of country seat or castle, which
he had dignified with the name of Aranea Hall. It was
in charge of Dame Tigrina whom we have just seen in
possession of the place. She was a monstrous character,
even among her own nation, but what she lacked in grace
she made up in her rude devotion to the Pixie cause
and leader.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>"You see, Dame Tigrina," said Spite, "I've brought
you two nice companions. You can't complain of being
solitary now."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the old hag, looking fiercely upon
the Brownies.</p>

<p>The Nurses were carried into an inner room of the
cavern. Its walls and ceiling were hung with beautiful
white silk tapestry. The floor was covered with a purple
silk carpet; cushions formed of yellow floss and fibres
of plants were spread for couches and chairs.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<p>"There, my lassies," said Spite, "you never slept in
such a room as this. I am sorry that I must leave you
immediately, but you shall be well cared for. Be
happy! and expect me soon." He dropped the curtain
partition or portiére and Faith and Sophia were alone
in their prison palace.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="chapname">A PIXIE INSURRECTION.</p>


<p>Fort Spinder was in a ferment. The unusual stir in
the Brownie camp was seen by the pickets on the outer
barricades, and they at once gave the alarm, thinking
that a night attack was to be made. The garrison
sprang to arms. The Pixies swarmed to the breastworks;
the Pixinees (as the females were called) mounted
the ramparts of the fort.</p>

<p>Now arose the trouble that Spite had anticipated.</p>

<p>"Where is the Captain?" The word ran from mouth
to mouth along barricades and breastwork. The Captain
was not to be found.</p>

<p>"Where is the Lieutenant, then?" The inquiry ran
through the Tegenaria quarter with the same puzzling
result. Presently a sentinel who had mounted guard
near the abutment of the old suspension bridge reported
that he had seen the two officers climb the pier and
go out upon the cables.</p>

<p>"Have they returned?"</p>

<p>No he had seen nothing of them since.</p>

<p>A rumor was started, and ran through the lines, that
Spite had been captured by the Brownies, and that had
caused the unusual excitement in their camp.</p>

<p>Then came another rumor that made headway amid
whispers, hints, and mutterings of "Treachery!" "Cowardice!"
"Desertion!" "Sold out to the Brownies!"</p>

<p>So the leaven of riot and panic began to work. Some
bewailed the missing officers as martyrs; some cursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
them as traitors; all mourned their absence as a fatal
blow to their own safety. Irritated by the uncertainty,
worn out by watching, fasting and fighting, the two
parties readily passed from words to blows.</p>

<p>"They are true as steel!"</p>

<p>"They are false traitors!"</p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>"Hah! take that!"</p>

<p>Words like these, followed by the clatter of claws,
and the sharp rasping of fangs were heard in every
quarter. Luckily the third in command, Lieutenant
Heady, was no milksop. He had seen riots and rebellions
before and had quelled them. In stubbornness, cunning
and ferocity he was a genuine Pixie. Fortune, it
seemed, had made him chief, for the time, at least. And
chief he would be, or cease to be at all.</p>

<p>He summoned a squad of the most courageous guards,
and with them passed along the line of barricades.
Quarrels were broken up with a strong hand, both
parties being impartially beaten. The seditious were
warned, the orderly praised, the doubters cheered, the
timorous encouraged.</p>

<p>That answered for a little while.</p>

<p>Once more the riot began.</p>

<p>Heady and his patrol renewed their round. But as
soon as a tumult was silenced in one quarter it arose in
another. No sooner had the police squad reduced matters
to quiet and moved to another point, than the riot
broke out afresh behind them. Finally it gathered
such headway that the Lieutenant was compelled to retire.
The ill feelings which the rioters had vented upon
one another were turned against him. The combatants
united to wreak a common vengeance upon Heady.</p>

<p>"He is a usurper!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 290px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 56.&mdash;Lieut. Heady and the Pixie Parson Among Admiring Pixinees.</span>
</div>

<p>"He wants to be chief himself!"</p>

<p>"He has made way with the other
officers so that he may seize the command!"</p>

<p>"Down with him! Death to
the tyrant!"</p>

<p>"Death! Death! Death!"</p>

<p>The whole seditious element
of the garrison gathered together,
and moved in a solid
mass upon Heady and his little
band of aids, who had fallen back
toward the tower that united the two
main quarters of the fort.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said he, "is it that you are
after? Very good, my brave boys!
There are two who can play the game
of death, as you shall learn!"</p>

<p>The Pixinees had assembled upon
the rampart and were looking down
grimly upon the tumult in the parade
ground or open space beneath. Heady
called to them to open the tower
gates. Now, strange to say, Heady
was a universal favorite among the
Pixinees. Which
one of his particular
qualities
won
their admiration
it would
be hard
to say, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the cross-grained and savage old crumdudgeon had a
host of enthusiastic friends among the Pixinees of
Fort Spinder. They always stood up for him, and the
cunning fellow knew well that he could count upon
them now; especially as the Pixie Parson,<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> who had
great influence among the Pixinees, was also his warm
friend.</p>

<p>The gates of the tower flew open immediately, and an
excited crowd of Pixinees gathered about their favorite.
They leaped from the ramparts. They climbed down
the walls. They thronged the gate. Their forms fairly
swelled with indignation. They were ready at a word
to fall upon the insurgents.</p>

<p>The mob paused at this demonstration. They did not
like the look of things. They began to consult among
themselves. A few in the rear ranks of the main body
dropped out one by one and sneaked off toward the
barricade. Heady spoke a few words to his Amazon
squad, and then approached the rioters. He advanced
several paces from the gate and addressed them.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you have chosen to submit this little
difference of opinion to a very grim sort of a judge
called&mdash;Death. I am ready to argue the case, and&mdash;there
is the court!" He pointed to the group of angry
Pixinees.</p>

<p>The leaders of the riot held a brief whispered consultation.
They were quite taken aback at this turn of
affairs.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen," continued Heady, in the same
cool, sneering tone. "The court is waiting. Are you
ready for trial?"</p>

<p>There is no telling what the issue might have been
had not the current of feeling been suddenly arrested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
During these moments of tumult a thin white speck had
been floating in from the lake. It sailed above the tops
of the trees, hovered over the fort, and gradually settled
down toward the parade ground. A voice was heard to
issue from it:</p>

<p>"Pixies, ahoy&mdash;oy!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_57" id="Fig_57"></a>
<img src="images/fig_057.jpg" width="300" height="357"

title="Fig. 57.&mdash;&quot;A Balloon Hung Overhead.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 57.&mdash;&quot;A Balloon Hung Overhead.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>All eyes turned upward. A balloon hung overhead
and just beyond,
toward the lake,
another and
another could be
seen.</p>

<p>"Lay hold of
the ropes!" called
a voice from the
nearest of these
ships of the sky.
"We want to descend
here. We
bear a message
from your chief."</p>

<p>A score of willing
hands were
reached out, and
the cords, which
by this time dragged upon the ground, were seized.
The little vessel, thus steadied, began to descend. It
touched the ground in a vacant space between the
rioters and the Pixinees. A small Pixie stepped from
the basket, and looked inquiringly around. He was
dressed in a dark gray coat, with broad white stripes;
breeches pale colored and spotted, and a black vest
over which a white-haired beard was streaming. He
seemed much puzzled at the strange grouping of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
parties around him, who for the most part had kept their
positions, but were looking quietly on, their interest in
the new arrival having nearly soothed their wrath.</p>

<p>"I should like to see Lieutenant
Heady," said the stranger. "I have a
message for him from Captain Spite
and Lieutenant Hide."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 58.&mdash;Gossamer&#39;s Balloons.</span>
</div>

<p>"I am the person you seek," said Heady, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>"If you will pardon me a moment, Sir," said the
stranger, "and give me some help in getting my comrades
anchored, I will deliver my message."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>The second of these little voyagers of the air reached
a position above the fort, and cast out cords and grapnels.
He soon anchored. Then another and another
followed until five had safely landed.</p>

<p>The interest of the fort Pixies in these æronauts had
now quieted the passions that had been so near fatal
explosion. Here was news from their missing officers.
All would now be well! By common consent both
parties put up their weapons and gathered around the
messenger.</p>

<p>"There is nothing secret in my orders, Sir, I think,"
said the balloonist who had first landed, "My name is
Lycosa. Here are my credentials. My orders I will
give when you are ready for them."</p>

<p>"Say on, then!" said Heady, "You couldn't have
come with them at a luckier time. What news from
our chiefs."</p>

<p>"Good news," answered Lycosa; "they crossed the
bridge, raided the Brownie camp, seized two of the
Nurses&mdash;the Commodore's daughter and the Boatswain's&mdash;and
have them safe on the island to hold as ransom
for your safe and quiet departure."</p>

<p>This news was received with unbounded favor and
applause, not hearty, ringing cheers such as Brownies
give, but a noisy clatter of fangs. The applause ceased
and Lycosa resumed.</p>

<p>"The capture of these prisoners was a masterly
stroke. The chiefs stole into the Brownie camp, seized
their captives from the very headquarters, and made
off with them. A scream from one of them aroused the
camp. The hue and cry was raised, and by the barest
chance Spite and Hide got off to sea on board a smuggler's
yacht."</p>

<p>"With their prisoners?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, all safe. They are in limbo now, ready to be
exchanged if need be. But the Captain hopes to keep
them for another and worse difficulty than the present."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 59.&mdash;Spite Sends off Lycosa and his Balloon Corps.</span>
</div>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Heady, "that would be hard to
find, I fancy. Go on!"</p>

<p>"He sends word by me that the old suspension bridge
is passable; that a few cables stretched across spans
Nos. 1, 2 and 4, will make it a quite good route. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
here with my companions, not only to bring the message,
but to do this work of repair."</p>

<p>"But when is it to be done," asked Heady, "and
how are we to make a landing in face of the enemy's
camp? The Brownies would climb the piers and cut
the strands under us; or would send their cavalry up to
do it, and attack parties crossing.</p>

<p>"They would swarm on the shore and prevent our
landing. They would have us at great disadvantage,
for they could destroy us one by one. A pretty plan
that! Perhaps our chiefs had better come and try
their own chances in it. No! let them send out their
she Brownies and try the ransom." Heady spoke with
much warmth and the Pixies applauded.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, General," said Lycosa, like a good
diplomat conciliating Heady with a high sounding title.
"All that has been attended to. The Fringe, a fast
yacht, has gone down to the outlet with your officers, to
order up the navy. The ships will be anchored off the
Old Bridge within two hours. It will then be the hour
just before dawn, which you know is the darkest of the
night. We can have the bridge ready for travel by
that time. Both your chiefs agree that the Brownies
will then be quieted down and will sleep more soundly
because of this disturbance. One of us, however, is to
make a balloon reconnoissance before the start from the
fort shall be made, to see whether all is quiet. The
navy will land your party as fast as they arrive, and we
can get over, it is thought, before daylight. Should the
movement be discovered, the ships can resist any onset
until all the garrison are off. That is the plan which I
bring. The chief orders the trial. If it fails, the
ransom plan will not."</p>

<p>Heady looked sullen, shook his head, and meditated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
for a few moments. No one spoke. All waited for his
decision.</p>

<div class="i60">
<p>"Well, lads," said the Lieutenant, looking around
with brightened face, "Is that little
unpleasantness settled? What say
you?"</p>

<p>The Pixies clapped their fangs in
chorus by way of approval.</p>

<p>"You will stop your nonsense, return
to duty and obey orders, will
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" was the unanimous response.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. To your posts,
all of you! Cousin Lycosa, go on with
your engineering, and draw on us for
all the men and material
that you need."</p>

<p class="noindent">Heady to look after repairs upon the
bridge. The mutiny was over. Once more Spite had
saved Fort Spinder. It was Lycosa and his companions,
just alighting upon Aranea's Isle in their balloons,
that had fixed the attention of the chief while
the Fringe approached the shore carrying the captive
Nurses. The whole plan of rescue flashed upon his
mind: he would send a balloon message to the fort,
and with it engineers to direct the repair of the Old
Bridge and the proposed escape thereby! Meantime
Hide and himself would bring up the fleet to convey
the garrison across the lake.</p>

<p>Lycosa and his chief assistant Gossamer lost no time
in beginning work. Their balloons were anchored by
strong cords to grass stalks, and hung in the air swaying
backward and forward ready for the embarkation.
They were hammock shaped silken structures, quite
wide at the middle, and gathered into a point at each
end. From the bow and stern floated filaments of silk,
which served the purpose of gas in human inventions
for air locomotion, that is to say, they buoyed up the
balloon so that it floated aloft.</p>

<p>The Pixie æronaut was seated in or beneath his hammock.
Gossamer's hammock or "car," was a rather
broad, close ribbon of silk but Lycosa's was a light
meshwork affair, just enough for his body to rest upon,
and which he aptly called his basket.<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a> When the time
came to ascend, the stay lines would be cut, the balloons
rise up and be carried along by the breeze. If he wished
to go higher, the balloonist opened his spinnerets, set
his tiny silk factory agoing, and thus by adding to the
number and length of the filaments increased the buoyancy
of the machine. If he wished to descend he gathered
up the floating lines into a little ball underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
his jaws, something like a seaman reefing sails, and as
the surface exposed to the air was diminished, the balloon
descended.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 61 and 62.&mdash;Madame Lycosa and American Dolomede Carrying Their Cocoons.</span>
</div>

<p>"Let go the ropes!" shouted Lycosa, as he climbed
by a thread into his car, which swung beneath the netted
hammock. The ropes were cut, and away the voyager
went to the Old Bridge, followed by his brother balloonists.
Assisted by the fort engineers, they stretched new
cables across the broken spans, and strengthened the old
ones. An hour's steady service finished all needful
repairs. Then Lycosa ascended from one of the piers,
made a survey of the Brownie camp, returned and reported
that the camp had settled into its usual quiet.
Rodney and his sailors were off to the inlet. Being certain
that the lost Nurses were not in the fort, the Brownies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
had recalled the extra pickets. There was little more
risk in crossing the bridge than had attended the venture
of Spite and Hide, especially as a fog now hung over
the shore. Lookouts were placed upon the shore pier to
watch for the fleet. All baggage and portable material
were packed. Some of the Pixinees took their children
upon their backs, like Madam Lycosa; others carried
their round, silken cradles in their jaws, like Madam
Pholcus, or lashed beneath their bodies, like Madam
Dolomede.<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>
Fort Spinder
was stripped
and ready to
be abandoned
to its
fate.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 63.&mdash;Madam English Ocyale Carries Her Cradle Lashed to Her Body.</span>
</div>

<p>Soon Lycosa's
signal
flag was seen
flying from
above the
pier. The
fleet was in
sight! The
news was passed rapidly from mouth to mouth along a
line of sentinels stationed on the bridge. The garrison
was set in motion. In a short space of time the whole
force had gone over without accident, and without a
sound loud enough to alarm the Brownie pickets, a result
much assisted by a contrivance of Lycosa's. To prevent
the noise made by vessels mooring to the shore, he caused
all the ships to anchor some distance from land.
He then attached cords to the masts and bowsprits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and by means of his balloons carried them directly
from the bridge to the ships. Thus there was no
tramping from abutment to lake across the bank. There
were no splash of oars and wash of waves by the plying
of boats from shore to ship.</p>

<p>The last soldiers had embarked. The cables were cut,
the anchors weighed, and with a favoring breeze the fleet
crossed the lake and anchored in Big Cave harbor on
the opposite or orchard shore. One of their camps or
villages was located here, and the wearied Pixies were
disembarked and comfortably housed.</p>

<p class="chapname">BROWNIES ON A LARK.</p>


<p>After the evening meal there usually comes a lull in
the duties of Brownie camp life. Pickets have been
told off and stationed at their posts, camp fires are
kindled, and the soldiers gather around the glowing
light, stretched upon the grass underneath the shadow
of leaves and flowers, or seated on rude stools of pebbles
and twigs. In chat and story they forget the fatigues
and dangers of a soldier's life. They spin yarns of past
adventure, tales of "moving accident by flood and
field" and "perils in the imminent deadly breach;"
they discuss the chances of the campaign, the strategy
and behavior of the enemy, and the merits of their commanders.
Jokes, quips, merry anecdotes and witty sayings
run around the circle, and ever and anon hearty
peals of laughter break out upon the still evening air.</p>

<p>"Ho, lads! Tone down your mirth a bit!" cried the
officer of the day to one of these groups, in the camp
before Fort Spinder.</p>

<p>"Aye! aye, Sir!" was the response, and for a moment
silence fell upon the circle.</p>

<p>"Say, boys," at last exclaimed one of the company,
"let's get out of this and go for a lark. I have a capital
idea in my head."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried Brownie Highjinks; "Twadeils
really has an idea in his head! I'll warrant it's a lively
one. Out with it! I'm for any fun that's not against
general orders."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well then, lads, come close together and listen."</p>

<p>Twadeils was one of two brothers who had got their
somewhat peculiar name from their daring and mischievous
spirit which kept them and most people around them
in a whirl of excitement and adventure. Their chums
nicknamed them the "Twa deils," and the two words at
length became one, and the lads were called Twadeils
Senior and Twadeils Junior. But among their fellows
they were simply known as "Twadeils" and "Junior."</p>

<p>The Brownies grouped themselves around Twadeils,
heard his plan, and with little question gave hearty
assent. An hour and place of meeting were fixed; and
after discussing details of the proposed lark in whispers
as they bent over the camp fire, the merry plotters
retired to their tents.</p>

<p>In due time they were up and assembled at the rendezvous.
The group that now started out upon their
secret adventure was made up of Brownies from all
arms of the service. The navy was represented by
Brownies Barck, Ferrie, Wetman and Obersee; the
cavalry by Brownies Gear, Saddler, Martingale, Hosson,
Howrode and Barnit; the infantry by Halfrick, Highjinks,
Esslade and the two Twadeils. A merry crowd
they were and as bold as merry. The story of their
night adventure we are now about to tell.</p>

<p>They silently stole from camp; passed the sentries
without much trouble, and reached the bank of the lake
close by the point where the Brownie picket line touched
the water. They were in a shallow depression formed
in earlier time by an overflow of the lake. The water
rose almost at this point to the surface of the shore, and
only a narrow ridge of sand hindered it from flowing
down the dry channel over which, indeed, it often ran
during freshets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Twadeils set Obersee and his sailor companions to form
a raft. They were handy at such work, and soon had a
number of beams lashed together into a rude raft that
was secure enough, at least for such adventurers as those
who expected to use it. The rest of the company were
set to digging at the sandy ridge which banked the lake.
All sorts of implements were used, drinking cups, table
pans, shovels extemporized from splinters, stalks and
chips picked from driftwood on the shore. Indeed, the
Brownies had been trained to turn a hand to such duty
without use of spades, shovels, picks or other trenching
tools.</p>

<p>By the time the raft was ready, a cut had been made
through the sand almost to the verge of the lake, and
the water had already begun to trickle over the top.
Then the final order was given, and all the Brownies fell
to with zeal, and removed the remaining sandy barrier.
Soon a breach was made in the shore through which the
lake water began to pour. The spirits of the Brownies
rose with the rising flood, and when at last enough water
had entered the channel to float the raft, they let it swing
out into the stream, and were afloat upon the swift running
current.</p>

<p>Their purpose was now made plain. They intended
to drown out the Pixie pickets, overflood and override
the barricade, and get into the heart of the Pixie camp.
But there were some difficulties in the way that these
reckless spirits had not considered. The water was as
frisky as themselves, and would not confine itself to the
course in which they had expected it to run, but turned
hither and thither, crawling among clumps and tufts of
weeds, grass and bushes, whose tops presently appeared
above the surface of the current, and lay in the way of
the raft as it floated down stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out there in front!" cried the leader but
before the raft could be pushed away it bumped against
a bush. Several Brownies were tossed into the stream,
and were pulled up with difficulty.
Now the raft was off
again, and its crew, a little
more careful, managed to avoid
the snags that threatened them
in front.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 182px;"><a name="Fig_64" id="Fig_64"></a>
<img src="images/fig_064.jpg" width="182" height="500" alt="Fig. 64.&mdash;Tetragnatha&#39;s Mimicry of a Green Twig." title="Fig. 64.&mdash;Tetragnatha&#39;s Mimicry of a Green Twig." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 64.&mdash;Tetragnatha&#39;s Mimicry of a Green Twig.</span>
</div>

<p>Soon the cry arose: "Look
out on the right!" Too late
again, for the raft was caught
in an eddy and driven among
the bushes on the margin of
the little torrent. Some of
the crew clambered upon the
bushes others plunged into
the stream, and by dint of
pushing and pulling, and many
hearty but subdued calls, and
with much laughter, the vessel
was released from the bushes
and pushed again into the current.
At this moment Esslade
saw the form of a Pixie
upon an overhanging bush. He
lay along the stem with arms
and legs stretched out before
and behind and held close together,
thus so tightly embracing the plant that it was
difficult at first to distinguish him therefrom.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Esslade, "I know that trick of yours,
Master Tetragnatha. I have seen you and your kin try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to cheat us before this by snugging yourself along stems
of plants, and keeping your great green coat and legs
down tight to 'em. You fooled me that way once, but
you can't do it again. Here boys, we must get the old
rascal out of that!"</p>

<p>So saying he sprang into the bush, laid hold of a limb,
and swung himself up to where the Pixie lay. Several
of his comrades quickly followed, but Tetragnatha had
no mind to meet them in fair combat. He jumped up,
and leaped from the stem into the midst of the current.
This sudden movement surprised the Brownies. They
paused, and gazed wonderingly at their foe, whom they
knew to be no water-pixie, and therefore expected to be
engulfed in the stream.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Wetman, "that was a foolish trick.
Might as well have stayed to be killed as to jump into
that current and be drowned; for drowned you surely
will be, old fellow."</p>

<p>But Wetman was mistaken. To the surprise of all
the Brownies, Tetragnatha instead of sinking, spread
his legs upon the water, floated for a moment or two with
the current, and then in the face of the stream began
slowly to approach the shore.</p>

<p>"What can this mean?" asked Gear. "How does
the creature manage it? What sort of hidden machinery
has that Pixie within himself to enable him to go contrary
to the current into the bushes on yonder shore?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, but we'll try to find out. So after him
boys, after him!" cried Twadeils.</p>

<p>The order was quickly obeyed, the raft was swung
into the stream, and partly urged by the current, and
partly impelled by poles and oars, the Brownies followed
the fleeing Pixie and almost overtook him. They were
just a little too late, for a moment before the raft touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the shore, Tetragnatha reached a low-hanging twig and
climbed to the top of a bush.</p>

<p>The Brownies, however, were determined not to be
foiled, so once more a party sprang into the limbs and
leaves, and followed the retreating Pixie. Tetragnatha
paused a moment, as though considering whether it
would be better to meet his enemies in open fight, or a
second time try the stream. But his foes were too many,
so he leaped upon the water. This time he varied his
method, for he made one end of a long cord fast to a
branch, meanwhile holding on to the other end, so that
when he alighted on the water the cord stretched out
behind him. This stayed and buoyed him up as he ran
off at full pace upon the surface of the stream.<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> As he
went, the thread stretched out, and seemingly would
have made no end of lengthening had not one of the
Brownies cut it. Tetragnatha was discomfited only for
a moment; then, to the surprise of his pursuers, instead
of sinking beneath the flood rode upon it, and turned
his course towards the shore. This time, however, the
Pixie's way led along a belt of bright moonlight that
glimmered through the branches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<img src="images/fig_065.jpg" width="316" height="500" alt="Fig. 65.&mdash;Pixie Tetragnatha&#39;s Escape.&mdash;(Illustration by Dan. C. Beard.)" title="Fig. 65.&mdash;Pixie Tetragnatha&#39;s Escape.&mdash;(Illustration by Dan. C. Beard.)" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 65.&mdash;Pixie Tetragnatha&#39;s Escape.&mdash;(Illustration by Dan. C. Beard.)</span>
</div>

<p>"Aha, lads!" exclaimed Rownie, who was standing
at the bow watching an opportunity to annoy his enemy,
"I see what's the mystery! The Pixie has spread a
sail! Look there! you can see it if you stoop low and
catch a side view of the silk as it shines in the moonlight!
Do you see now? Tetragnatha has lifted his
body from the surface of the water and has set his spinning
machinery a-going; and now you may see the
outspun threads glinting in the moonlight. A long
pencil of silken lines is spread out from the spinnerets
above him, while at the same time he has fastened his
feet together by a little silken raft. The raft buoys him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
upon the water; the floating filaments act as sails; the
wind is blowing right toward the bank yonder, so that
in spite of the current which heads off this way, the
creature is able to sail over the surface of the water.
There he goes! He is bound to make land."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;"><a name="Fig_66" id="Fig_66"></a>
<img src="images/fig_066.jpg" width="280" height="400" alt="Fig. 66.&mdash;Tetragnatha: &quot;The Floating Filaments Act as Sails.&quot;" title="Fig. 66.&mdash;Tetragnatha: &quot;The Floating Filaments Act as Sails.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 66.&mdash;Tetragnatha: &quot;The Floating Filaments Act as Sails.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Rownie had seen truly. This was
another of the tricks of that strange and
cunning craft which was continually
being unfolded before the
Brownies' eyes. Tetragnatha was now safe on
dry land, and scampered off among the bushes.</p>

<p>Once more the adventurers pushed into the current.
The stream bore to the opposite side, making a
long curve which brought
them close up to the picket
line of their own troops.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Twadeils,
"Yonder is one
of our sentinels, close
up to the edge of the
stream! Down flat on
the raft,
every one of
you; quick,
and lay low
till we are
quite past."
The Brownies
tumbled
at the word
and spread themselves along the logs in as small space
as they could assume, although their position was anything
but comfortable, for the water continually washed
over them, or spurted up upon them through the chinks
of the raft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!" cried the Brownie sentinel, "What
boat is that?"</p>

<p>No answer, and the raft sped silently by.</p>

<p>"Halt, there!" shouted the sentinel, running after
the vessel. "Halt, I say, or I will fire on you."</p>

<p>He paused, raised his bow and let fly an arrow. It
was well aimed and sank into a log close by the head of
Highjinks. Indeed it pierced his Scotch bonnet and
tore it from his head. This fidgety Brownie could no
longer be restrained, and although the raft had now been
carried quite out of reach, he leaped to his feet, pulled
out the arrow, waved it and his bonnet above his head,
and called to the sentinel, whom he knew well:</p>

<p>"Say, old chappie, save your shots for Pixies. Don't
you see, you rascal, you've spoiled my hat, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lie down, you ninnie," cried Twadeils in a whisper,
"you'll give us away! We'll be stopped, taken back
to camp, and put in the guard house, every one of us!"</p>

<p>Thereupon several Brownies quietly pulled Highjinks
down upon the logs. By this time the raft had swung
round a clump of brushwood, leaving the sentinel gazing
in a dazed way after the mysterious vessel. Scarcely
had they rounded the point when a huge Pixie darted
from the grasses near them, and, after making a few
rapid strides upon the current, dived into the stream.</p>

<p>"Hello! here's game," cried Twadeils. "Stop the
raft a moment." Ferrie swung the bow around. Saddler
and Barnit seized the ropes and jumped into the
nearest bushes; then holding back lustily, the clumsy
vessel was soon stopped.</p>

<p>"Now get her up to the place where the Pixie went
down," said Twadeils. "I know him well. He is one
of the Dolomede band of water-pixies. Sixpoint Dolomede
they call him. Steady, here he is!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking down into the water the Brownies saw Sixpoint
clinging to the stem of an overflowed plant.</p>

<p>"What a curious looking creature he is!" exclaimed
Hosson. "He has put on a coat of armor that shines
like silver even through the water. How did he get
it?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," exclaimed Halfrick, "but I will see
whether it is proof against my spear."</p>

<p>He steadied himself upon the raft and drew back to
strike. The sharp implement cut through the water,
and as Halfrick leaned over the edge of the raft to
watch the result of his stroke, he was suddenly made
conscious of an effect very different from that he had
counted upon. He could not have been more surprised
if an earthquake had struck him.</p>

<p>Sixpoint, at the touch of the spear, unclasped his hold
upon the stem, darted upward, and struck with full force
against the under part of the bow, which shot upward
into the air until the raft stood on one end in the
water. It was much as though a huge whale were to
come up underneath a fishing boat. Halfrick was heaved
into the air like a rocket, and after several somersaults
alighted in some near-by boughs. The rest of the company
slid along the logs and dropped together into the
stream. A more surprised set of Brownies perhaps never
was seen. They arose to the surface, sputtering and
struggling, and one after another laid hold of the raft,
which had now righted itself. But as they climbed up
at one end, Sixpoint clambered upon the other. His
weight dragged the bow under the water, and the stern
tossed into the air throwing the Brownies forward. They
were flung directly upon the great Pixie, who was as
much surprised by the sudden movement, which he took
for an assault, as were the Brownies themselves, and
backed off into the stream dragging down the bow with
him.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 67.&mdash;Pixie Sixpoint Upsets the Raft.&mdash;(Illustration by Dan. C. Beard.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>Meantime the Brownies had returned toward the stern
of the raft, and as Sixpoint let go his hold the bow rose
in the water. This see-sawing of the vessel and the
oddity of the proceeding touched the Brownies' risibilities,
and they began to laugh. Soon the whole party were
in a tumult of mirth, in the midst of which Dolomede
gravely thrust out his forepaws, deliberately climbed upon
the raft and began to look around. Thereupon several
of the Brownies dropped into the water beside the logs.
Among these was Gear, who, while he floundered about
and ducked his head, said, "Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;what's become of
the brute's armor? don't you see he has stripped it off?
Wh&mdash;what do you think he has d&mdash;d&mdash;done with it?"</p>

<p>"Such a fellow!" said Junior, who was treading water
beside Gear, "I believe you would ask questions and
study problems in Natural History if you were dying.
Here lads," he added, "it's a burning shame that this
Pixie has possession of our raft. Let's up and at him!"</p>

<p>The party climbed out of the water, drew their weapons
and cautiously advanced, but Sixpoint thought
discretion the better part of valor, for, without waiting
for his enemies to attack, he dropped into the stream
and sank beneath the surface. The Brownies rushed to
the edge of the raft just in time to see the Pixie moving
out of reach from stem to stem of the submerged plants.</p>

<p>"Look, boys!" cried Gear, "He has his silver armor
on again. How is the thing done? It looks like magic!"</p>

<p>"Suppose you dive down and ask the old fellow, dear
boy," said Highjinks. "No doubt he will lend you a
brand new suit for yourself, if you like."</p>

<p>Dolomede was by this time quite hidden from view,
and any attempt to follow would have been vain. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Twadeils ordered all hands aboard, and once more set
sail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;"><a name="Fig_68" id="Fig_68"></a>
<img src="images/fig_068.jpg" width="317" height="425" alt="Fig. 68.&mdash;&quot;The Triple-Decked Tower of Linyphia.&quot;" title="Fig. 68.&mdash;&quot;The Triple-Decked Tower of Linyphia.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 68.&mdash;&quot;The Triple-Decked Tower of Linyphia.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Perhaps we may stop to explain the point that puzzled
Gear. The silver armor was nothing, in fact, but bubbles
of air that clung to Sixpoint's hairy coat. It is the
fashion of water-pixies to spread out the numerous hairs
upon their furry skins just as they plunge beneath the
surface of the water. Portions of air within the spaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
between the hairs cling around the body, held thereto
by the pressure of the surrounding water. This air
gathers in round bubbles which shine like silver, and
have somewhat the appearance of a coat of mail. They
probably furnish the air for the creature to breathe while
in the water, and they of course disappear into the
atmosphere the moment the surface is reached.</p>

<p>Once more the Brownies were afloat, and now they
drew near the barricades, and saw the damage wrought
by the flood upon the Pixie defences. The water had
overflowed the demilune, so that only the end towers
showed above the surface; and these swayed to and fro
before the force of the rushing current and under the
weight of the Pixie sentinels who, as it seemed to the
Brownies, must have been driven to refuge within them, so
suddenly had the flood broken out. The triple-decked
tower of Linyphia was crowded with these fugitives.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," said Twadeils, "here's our chance for
fine sport. What say you? Shall we push our raft
right over the barricade to the gate of the fort? Or
stop and pick up some of the fellows imprisoned here in
the towers?"</p>

<p>"It is bad policy to leave an enemy in one's rear,"
said Rownie.</p>

<p>"You mean that a Pixie in a bush is worth two in a
fort, don't you?" exclaimed Ferrie.</p>

<p>"It will soon be time for us to be in our quarters,"
said Howrode, pointing to the faint blush of coming
dawn in the eastern horizon. "If we are not in by reveille
it will be rather hard on us. We will not be able
to get through more work than we can find here among
these towers."</p>

<p>These opinions were heartily endorsed by the majority
of the party, and the raft was directed toward one
of the central towers.</p>

<p class="chapname">HOW THE LARK ENDED.</p>


<p>The water had risen around the demilune, covering
the entire line of works except the tall towers above
the two ends and on either side of the central gate. The
raft was steered toward the tower at the western end.
This was a dome-shaped structure wrought by bending
together and lashing several leaves, which then looked
like the crown of a peaked hat. The inside was neatly
tapestried with silk, and on all sides of the opening,
which looked downward, were strung guy ropes and
cross lines. Above the whole, was curved, like the
plume of a helmet, a leaf with a long stem, whose point
was bent downward and fastened to the roof.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> This
formed a watch tower or lookout for a sentinel who
could thence scan the surrounding space and give warning
of approaching danger.</p>

<p>"Yonder is the lookout, lads!" said Twadeils as the
raft swung toward the tower; "but he seems to be taking
it very coolly, for although he must see us, he makes
no sign of giving warning. But, we had better not trust
to that; push on as fast as possible, and put him beyond
the power of raising an alarm. Give way, lads, give
way heartily!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir!" was the answer, and the raft soon lay
alongside the tower.</p>

<p>"Fasten the painter to one of those lines," was the
next order. "Gear, you may lead the cavalrymen to
the lookout, and I'll head the attack on the main
tower."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>"All right," said Gear; "I know the company which
the fellow up there belongs to. A keen lot they are, too,
as bright as the scarlet uniform that gives them the name
of the 'Cardinal Company.'<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> Come on, Brownies!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_69" id="Fig_69"></a>
<img src="images/fig_069.jpg" width="400" height="444" alt="Fig. 69.&mdash;Leaves Lashed or Sewed Into a Turret Den." title="Fig. 69.&mdash;Leaves Lashed or Sewed Into a Turret Den." />

</div>

<p>He seized the tower guy
ropes, and guiding his course
by the stems of the leaves,
began the ascent followed
closely by his comrades, Saddler,
Halfrick and Barnit.
Up they went, hand over hand, everyone trying to beat
his leader to the top, which they were not long in reaching.
As they hung at the edge a moment and looked
over it, they saw the Pixie watchman standing rampant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
at the opposite side of the lookout. His scarlet tunic
shone bright in the moonlight, and the metallic green
of his fangs glistened as he gnashed them together in
defiance.</p>

<p>"Surrender!" shouted Gear.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 259px;">
<img src="images/fig_070.jpg" width="259" height="300" alt="Fig. 70.&mdash;&quot;Standing Rampant.&quot;" title="Fig. 70.&mdash;&quot;Standing Rampant.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 70.&mdash;&quot;Standing Rampant.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Cardinalis shook one arm threateningly by way of
answer. The Brownies now made a rush toward the
Pixie, but before they could reach him he vaulted into
the air, and passing
over his assailants'
heads,
lit on the opposite
side of the
lookout. The
Brownies could
not check their
speed and tumbled
against and
over one another,
as they reached
the spot where
the Pixie had
stood.</p>

<p>"Well jumped,"
cried Gear,
recovering himself, "but you shall not miss us next
time." He seized the dragline, which the vaulting
legionaries always stretch behind them when they jump,
and gave it a stout tug as he faced about. Cardinalis
cut the line with his claw, and turning sharply faced his
foes, and as they approached backed quietly down the
stern of the leaf to the roof of the tower.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a></p>

<p>"Foiled again," cried Gear, as the squad of Brownies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
scurried after the retreating Pixie, "but you can't
escape us a third time." His boast was too soon made,
however, for before his party could reach the tower,
Cardinalis had scampered down the guy ropes to the
Brownie raft. Thither he was followed by Gear and his
men who were now well warmed to their work and boiling
with vexation at their two failures. Halfrick was the
first to reach the raft, and as he charged with poised
spear, Cardinalis sprang upon him. Halfrick sank upon
one knee, dropped the end
of his spear to the deck, and
received upon the point
the force of the assault.
The spear point penetrated
the Pixie's breast, but the
staff was shattered, and
Halfrick borne to the deck.
His comrades were at his
side in an instant, but before
he was relieved, the
dying Pixie buried his fangs in his shoulder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/fig_071.jpg" width="250" height="220" alt="Fig. 71.&mdash;&quot;Well jumped!&quot;" title="Fig. 71.&mdash;&quot;Well jumped!&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 71.&mdash;&quot;Well jumped!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Has any one a cruse of Lily Balm?" asked Gear.
No one answered. The thoughtless fellows had not
counted upon accidents and wounds when they planned
their lark.</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad!" Gear exclaimed. "But we
must do the next best thing." He tore the skirts of his
coat into strips and tied a bandage tightly around the
shoulder between the hurt part and the body. He then
put his lips to the wound and sucked the poison into his
mouth. Halfrick had already fallen into a stupor, and
was laid in an easy position upon the raft, where his
comrades watched him with sad countenances.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile how fared it with Twadeils and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
party? They had little difficulty in mounting to the
tower, but as they entered the leafy dome, they found
themselves faced by the huge proportions of Shamrock,
the tower-keeper. Near him were two Pixies belonging
to the Vaulting Legion who had taken refuge from the
flood within the tower, and whose bright eyes shone out
of the deep shadows wherein they lay.</p>

<p>The Brownies had a hard task before them, for they
must hang to the tapestried sides of the tower with one
hand, while they kept the sword arm free. Moreover,
they were to attack from beneath, and face an assault
which coming from above would be much more serious.
But they knew nothing of fear and little of prudence,
and pushed on holding their swords above them, which
thus formed a bristling circle of points against which
their enemies must cast themselves if they chose to
attack. The moonlight shone brightly upon objects
beneath, but little got within the dome, and all above
them was in shadow; only the outlines of the Pixies
dimly showed against the white tapestry of the walls.</p>

<p>Silently and slowly, but steadily the circle of Brownie
sword points moved upward into the shadow, narrowing
as they rose. The affray promised to be a bloody one,
and even the most reckless of the party had begun to
feel the sobriety of the moment, when the advance was
suddenly arrested by a voice calling from above them.</p>

<p>"Halt! We surrender!" It was Pixie Shamrock
that spoke.</p>

<p>"Halt!" echoed Twadeils, although the command
was scarcely needed, for his company had stopped at the
first word. Yet, they suspected a Pixie trick, and every
arm held the sword blade more firmly, and all eyes were
more keenly on the alert.</p>

<p>Shamrock perceived that the Brownies distrusted him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and again spoke: "We are
in earnest. No trick is intended.
Descend, and we will
follow you and give ourselves
up. We have good reasons for
our strange action. We have
been deserted and deceived by
Spite the Spy and our own
friends, and shall not now throw
our lives away to please or profit
them. You may trust my
word."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 232px;"><a name="Fig_72" id="Fig_72"></a>
<img src="images/fig_072.jpg" width="232" height="575" alt="Fig. 72.&mdash;Shamrock&#39;s Fernleaf Tower." title="Fig. 72.&mdash;Shamrock&#39;s Fernleaf Tower." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 72.&mdash;Shamrock&#39;s Fernleaf Tower.</span>
</div>

<p>After a brief whispered
consultation, Twadeils concluded
it wise policy to accept
the offered surrender,
and gave orders to descend.
It must be confessed
that he was
glad to do this, for
he began to fear that
serious results would
follow, and even that
if they should be victorious,
precious lives
would be lost. There was
no relaxing vigilance as
the Brownies descended,
and when they reached the
raft and saw the senseless
form of Halfrick stretched
upon the deck, they were
still better satisfied that they
had found so easy an issue
from their adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pixies, true to their word for once at least, came
down quietly, and let themselves be bound, after which
Shamrock told the following story, which seemed strange
indeed to his captors: "Our sentries were stationed last
evening as usual, although it was expected that Fort
Spinder would be abandoned some time during the
night. 'Keep up an active patrol,' said the Captain of
the Guard. 'Show yourselves freely to the enemy's
pickets, until you get orders from me to retire. Then
quietly and hastily withdraw from your posts, and we
will go off in the last ship load.'</p>

<p>"That seemed all right, and the sentinels on duty, of
whom we are a part, suspected nothing when, during the
night, the relief guard were ordered to headquarters
under pretence of receiving some secret instructions
from the Chief. But they never returned. We kept
watch long after the time for changing guard; no corporal
appeared. Then we sent a messenger to the fort
to see what was the matter. He soon returned saying
that the fort was abandoned. Not a Pixie was left
except the sentinels at the posts! We had been fooled,
betrayed, deserted and given over to death by our selfish
Chief, who left us as decoys to keep up the appearance
that the fort was occupied, in order to deceive you
Brownies. A madder lot of Pixies never was seen. If
we could have gotten hold of our chiefs we would have
made mincemeat of them in short order.</p>

<p>"But storming and swearing didn't help matters.
What should we do? That was the question. We even
thought of going straight to your camp and blowing on
the whole mean pack, and would have done it, I think,
only we feared you folks would think it a bit of Spite's
strategy and cut our throats for our pains. In the
midst of our deliberations a flood burst upon us from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
some unseen quarter. The very witches seemed to be
abroad and conspiring against us. We could not imagine
the source, as there was no rain. The water-pixies
readily escaped to the land and are now in hiding somewhere,
but the rest of us fled from point to point until at
last we were cooped up in the towers. Now you can
understand why, being thus betrayed, confused and
mystified, we had little stomach for fighting, and preferred
to surrender, if for nothing else than to get even
with our miserable dog of a chief, Spite the Spy. If
you'll take the trouble to go to the other towers you'll
probably find all our comrades in the same mood."</p>

<p>Here was startling news indeed for the Brownies!
What should they do? At all events, they wouldn't
tell their prisoners that they were only a chance squad
of runaways out on a lark! Some serious duty seemed
to be before them. The suggestion to visit the other
towers and bag all the Pixies therein was a strong
temptation; but ought they not now to push straight to
camp? An unlooked for circumstance brought the
question to a swift conclusion.</p>

<p>The water began to subside almost as rapidly as it
had risen, but the Brownies were so intent upon Shamrock's
story that they failed to note the fact. The raft's
bow had been tied by a short rope to the tower, and as
the water ran out, the stern of the vessel gradually
settled, and by the time the Pixie tale was fairly told,
was quite out of water and loosely lodged upon a clump
of grasses. Suddenly these gave way and the raft began
to tilt into an inclined plane.</p>

<p>"Look out, lads!" cried Hosson, "Hold fast all!
The raft's upsetting!" The warning came just in time
to allow Halfrick's attendants to seize and save him
from being shot into the stream. Highjinks, finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
himself slipping down, flung himself into the water by a
double somersault, and several others joined him, while
those who clung to the raft were flung together in a
huddle, Brownies and Pixies sprawling over and clinging
to one another. Wetman, who chanced to be near the
bow, clambered up and cut the painter, whereupon the
raft fell into the stream with a splash, and the water
washing over the deck gave the crew a ducking. The
incident excited the mirthfulness of the Brownies, who
broke into merry laughter, and those on board began to
chaff those in the stream. Some one hailed Highjinks,
who was cutting lively antics in the water, and struck
up a familiar doggerel, something after the fashion of
modern college ditties.</p>

</div></div>

<p>No sooner was the song started than all the crew
joined in it. The strain was a dolorous one, and the
refrain ended in a peculiar note on the syllable "er,"
combining something of a sigh, a shriek and a grunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
upon which all the singers laid the full stress of their
voices, and stopped with a sudden jerk. The whole effect
was comical; and the third verse seemed so pat to the
case in hand that it was followed by a roar of laughter
that fairly raised the night echoes.</p>

<p>Ferrie, who was something of a wag, saw Gear splashing
and spluttering in vain efforts to ascend the raft, for
he was but an indifferent swimmer, and broke into an
extemporized verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little Gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come quick<br /></span>

<span class="i2">You out of the creek&mdash;eek&mdash;<i>er!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The effort was hailed with applause, and the refrain
was repeated with rousing effect by the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of the creek&mdash;eek&mdash;<i>er!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gear took the sally good naturedly, and as he was
quite as quick at repartée as Ferrie, sang back from the
waves, sputtering and stuttering as he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">M&mdash;m&mdash;Merrie Ferrie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;shallow fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I'll stick<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You into the creek&mdash;eek&mdash;<i>er!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Good!" shouted the Brownies, with another hearty
peal of laughter, as they repeated the refrain. What a
trifling matter will pass for genuine wit among friends
who are all in a good humor, and ready to be pleased
with every honest attempt at innocent fun!</p>

<p>But Twadeils thought that matters had gone quite
far enough, indeed, too far. "Come, come, lads,"
he said, "this must end. Matters have taken too serious
a turn for further mirth. Our lark must end just here.
Pull the raft to shore."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Captain," said Highjinks, who had drawn
himself out of the water, and stood on the end of the raft
shaking himself with many grimaces. "I'll reduce myself
to order, and help reduce your order to execution."
Whereupon he plunged again into the flood, and aided
by one or two others soon had the raft free from the entangling
remains of the demilune. In a few moments it
touched the bank where, with some merry words of mock
farewell, it was abandoned.</p>

<p>Twadeils now called his comrades around him.
"Brownies," he said, "our adventure has taken a more
serious and important turn than I had expected. We
have a wounded comrade whom we must get into the
hospital as soon as possible; we have these prisoners to
deliver to Captain Bruce, and above all we have news
of the utmost value, which ought not to be held back a
moment longer than necessary."</p>

<p>"But is the news true, comrade?" interrupted Gear.
"Aren't we being gulled by these Pixies? Lying is their
native speech."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," replied Twadeils, "and am
not willing to go into camp with such a story on the
naked word of our prisoners; although I believe, from
several circumstantial proofs, that they have told the
truth this time, if never before. I propose to send out
a scout to find out the facts. We shall wait here for his
report. What say you?"</p>

<p>All agreed with their leader, and the whole party
clamored to be sent as scouts; but Twadeils appointed
his brother Junior, with Barck and Howroad. Junior
pushed toward the fort, gradually bearing in the direction
of the central gate. Soon the party passed a clump
of ox-eyed daisies whose tall blooms towered above the
fort walls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is a good place to make an observation," said
Junior. "Barck, mount that tallest stem and tell us
what you see."</p>

<p>Barck as a sailor was well used to climbing, and in a
few moments reached the blossom; but just as he was
clambering over the edge of
the white leaves, he seemed
to miss his footing and fell
to the ground. His fall was
broken by a clump of grass,
but he lay stunned and
motionless.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 191px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 73 and 74.&mdash;&quot;Standing Rampant, with Claws Uplifted as Though to Strike.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>His comrades ran to him
and tried to restore him. "I
never knew Barck to make
a slip of that sort before,"
said Howroad; "he's one of
the surest footed topmen in
the fleet, and can climb like
a monkey."</p>

<p>"True enough," said Junior,
"and I don't understand
it, but we must not
allow this accident to thwart
our purpose. Do you watch
our comrade, and I'll try
my luck at climbing for an
observation."</p>

<p>So saying, he began the as
cent, and as he was a skillful
athlete readily reached the top. He took the precaution
to peep over the edge before he got upon the
flower, but saw nothing. The coast was clear! He
stood up and turned to survey the fort, but was startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
by a rustling noise at the further margin of the daisy.
He turned, and drew his sword.</p>

<p>"Who is here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>There was no answer. But now gazing steadily in
the direction from which the sound came, he saw the
dim outlines of a Pixie standing rampant with claws
uplifted as though to strike. The mystery of Barck's
fall was solved! Junior recognized in the creature before
him one of the Laterigrade Legion,
a well known character. His
uniform was generally yellow,
and he was in the habit
of ambushing in yellow flowers.
The daisy
was a favorite resort
wherein he
would lay alone
for many days,
hugging the yellow
heart of the
large flower, and
quite concealed
from a careless
observer. Sometimes
he resorted
to other plants,
and then his uniform
took the tint of their flowers, a fact which gave
him the popular name of Turncoat Tom.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> As Barck
had clambered upon the daisy unthinking of danger,
Turncoat Tom had struck him on the head, and the
mariner, quite off his guard, was knocked to the ground.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 261px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 75.&mdash;Turncoat Tom on a Daisy. (Misumena vatia).</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>"You miserable, sneaking Turncoat," cried the
Brownie, wrathful at his friend's mishap. "You shall
pay for this dearly!" and thereupon he assaulted the
Pixie furiously.</p>

<p>A duel on a daisy! It was a strange occurrence even
in Brownie world. The duel was of short duration, for
a skillful stroke of Junior's sword severed one of Turncoat
Tom's claws, whereupon he sidled, crabwise, over
the edge of the daisy, after the fashion of his tribe, and
leaped sheer of the flower into the grass beneath, fortunately
on the side opposite to where Barck lay. Junior
peered over the edge and saw the form of his wounded
adversary glide into the shadows and disappear.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Brownie, as he put up his sword, "I
dare say that is another of the abandoned sentinels, and
he has been punished enough. Let him go!"</p>

<p>He turned once more to survey the fort, which lay
under the full light of the moon, quite exposed in every
part. It was silent as a cemetery. Not a sentinel was
seen at the gates, on the walls, on the towers, or on the
parade ground. Not a boat lay at the landing. Not a
sign of life anywhere except on the Arenicola tower,
where the grim flag of the Pixies floated from its staff,
having evidently been left, like the sentinels of the
demilune, to keep up the impression that the fort was
still occupied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 76.&mdash;&quot;A Duel on a Daisy.&quot; Junior and Turncoat Tom.</span>
</div>

<p>Well satisfied, Junior descended and was pleased to
find that Barck had now recovered consciousness. He
had no idea what had happened to him, only knowing
that as he crawled upon the daisy a sudden stroke, like
a shock of electricity, had fallen upon his head and
smitten him to the ground. With a sailor's superstition,
he was disposed to think the fall the result of some
miserable witch work. Junior having relieved his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
on this subject, dispatched Howroad to report to his
brother and recommend that all the Brownies join him
with their prisoners. Twadeils approved, and by the
time the party had come up Barck was well enough to
join in the march with a little aid, and was soon as
lively as the rest.</p>

<p>All were now in the best of spirits. Twadeils resolved
to pass through the fort by the central gate, go out by
the water gate, and re-enter camp by the lake front.</p>

<p>"Lads," he said, when he had told his plans, "we had
expected to slip through the lines before reveille, be safe
in our quarters for morning duty, and keep our lark to
ourselves as a theme for campfire yarns. But all that
is now done for. Public duty requires us to go in
openly and make a full breast of all our doings. We
deserve punishment, of course, and shall get it; but we
may hope to get off easily, for we bring great news.
Then, we have three Pixie prisoners; and as we go
through the fort we will haul down yonder black flag
and carry it home as a trophy, and a rare one it will be.
The one drawback to all this is poor Halfrick there.
But let us hope that the Nurses can yet pull him through
safely. And now, attention! Forward, march!"</p>

<p>Off they set, then, in high spirits, which, however,
they faithfully kept within the bounds of quiet mirthfulness.
They moved cautiously until they had passed
the central gate; but once within the fort, they found
that the place was beyond doubt deserted. Hosson and
Wetman were sent aloft to pull down the Pixie flag
from Arenicola's Tower, and having secured this valued
trophy, they hurried homeward. Notwithstanding their
leader's warning, the highly excited Brownies could not
wholly restrain their joy as this emblem of their wicked
enemy's power descended from the proud place where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
had floated in triumph and defiance. Highjinks started
in a jubilant voice a popular camp song, which seemed
quite pat to the occasion. His comrades at once united
with him in the rollicking strain, whose chorus at least
we may venture to quote.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Del-en-<i>do</i> est Car-tha-<i>go</i>!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">Car-tha-<i>go</i> has got to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">For the Romans, don't you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">They have sworn it shall be so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">Car-tha-<i>go</i> has got to go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Del-en-<i>do</i> est Car-tha-<i>go</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Think of it! A Brownie scouting party singing a
Brownie camp song in the centre of a Pixie fort! It
was an inspiring thought, and with a ringing stress upon
the refrain that woke loud echoes through the silent
streets, halls, and towers of Fort Spinder, the Brownies
sang.</p>

<p>Then with three cheers and a tiger, the jolly crew once
more yielded to Twadeils' remonstrance, composed themselves
to quietude and marched briskly away. Nevertheless,
frequently as they moved along they kept time
to the hummed notes of the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Del-en-<i>do</i> est Car-tha-<i>go</i>!"<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">WOOED BUT NOT WON.</p>


<p>Notwithstanding the fatigues of the day and night
Spite did not seek rest. Leaving the command of
Orchard Camp with Hide, he went aboard the "Fringe"
and sailed over to the island. The boat was run in
under the willows, and at his own request Raft went
with Spite to the lodge of Dame Tigrina.</p>

<p>"You would be more welcome if you'd come at a
respectable season," was the greeting which the old
creature gave her master.</p>

<p>"Well, well, mother, you must bear with me this
time. It isn't often I trouble you. And, you know,
you never lose anything by serving me. How are your
new boarders? Asleep, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Asleep? not they! They have done nothing the
whole night but weep, and pray, and bemoan their condition."</p>

<p>"Poor things!" said Spite, "I suppose they are pining
to see me, again! Hey, mother?"</p>

<p>Dame Tigrina showed her fangs in what was intended
for a grin, and led the way into the "Brownie Bower,"
as Spite merrily called the place where Faith and Sophia
were confined.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my pretty birds," said the chief, as
he entered the chamber. "It is rather early for a call
of ceremony on young ladies. But, really, you must
excuse me for once, as time is precious just now. Besides,
I come on business,&mdash;business of great importance.
And that is always a good excuse for untimely visits."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nurses rose as the Pixies entered the room. They
stood with arms clasped about each other, casting beseeching
glances at their dread enemy, but saying nothing.</p>

<p>"Come, Mistress Faith," continued Spite, "I have
some private words to speak to you. Now no scenes,
please! If you want to be well treated act sensibly.
There, Sophie, you can go to the other side of the
room. What I have to say concerns Faith alone."</p>

<p>He loosened the clasped arms of the captives and led
Faith aside. The Brownie maiden shrank back from
the Pixie's approach, drew herself up and stood facing
her persecutor. Her face was sad almost to despair, but
a quiet firmness in her eyes showed that although she
thought best to be silent, she had braced herself to resist
or suffer to the utmost.</p>

<p>"I am a plain, rough-spoken person, Faith," began
Spite, "and I shall waste no words in telling you my
wish and purpose. I love you. I want you for a wife.
I mean to marry you."</p>

<p>Faith started, shrank back yet further, drew herself
up yet more, but remained silent.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to marry in my own race, for reasons
which I do not care to explain. But I have long felt
the need of some one to preside over my household. I
have chosen you to that honor. Are you ready to accept
it without more ado?"</p>

<p>Faith's cheeks blushed crimson at these words. Her
eyes flashed as she answered: "Spite, chief, Pixie, fiend!&mdash;whatever
you call yourself, what evil spirit could have
devised such an unholy scheme? Faith ally herself with
you? Never! Do the worst you can do at once. I can
die. I am not afraid to die. Strike! But say no more
of a matter the very thought of which is revolting." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
spoke quietly, but there were firmness and fire in her
tones before which even Spite quailed for a moment.</p>

<p>He was not long abashed. "That sounds very fine,"
he replied, "and I suppose is the proper thing to say,
and all that, in such cases. Let us take all such high
and virtuous stuff for granted, however, and come
straight to business. Now first, you have such an offer
as no Brownie ever yet dreamed of. You may be queen
of the Pixies. You shall have a palace&mdash;yes, a score
of palaces if you like. Servants, honors, garments of
the richest silk, table luxuries from air and earth and
water&mdash;everything that heart could possibly wish of
honor, riches and comfort shall be yours. What have
you to say to that?"</p>

<p>"That not all the kingdoms of this earth, could you
bestow them on me, would buy me to be a Pixie's bride."</p>

<p>"Then, second," continued Spite, not noticing the reply,
"you will be in a position to act as a mediator between
your people and ours. You could have many
opportunities for doing good to your friends and kin.
The alliance which I propose would also give you a
power for good over our people. Even if you were
asked to make a sacrifice, it would be your duty to do
so since thereby you would widen the sphere of your
influence. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I say, as I have ever been taught, that it is not lawful
to do evil that good may come. It is a delusion and
a snare to say that such a wicked union as you ask
could have any other than a disastrous end."</p>

<p>"Then, third," continued Spite with the same cool indifference
to Faith's indignant words, "third and last,
you might as well submit gracefully to your destiny.
You can't help yourself. You are in my hands. I
shall marry you whether you like or no. You will only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
bring sorrow and pain upon yourself and friends by your
stubbornness, and will do no good in the end. I have
finished my business. I don't mean to press it just now.
Think over it carefully. If your good sense is equal to
your reputation, you will conclude to live queen of the
Pixies, with a good heart. The next time I come I
shall expect to have your betrothal kiss. I leave you
now to refresh yourself with sleep. Good night!"</p>

<p>While Spite was thus addressing Faith, Sophia in the
other end of the room was approached by the smuggler.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir," she cried, "you showed us kindness on the
boat. I know you must have a good heart, even if you
are a Pixie. Have pity on us, and save us from this
horrible dungeon."</p>

<p>"Softly, softly, my pretty lass," responded Raft.
"You are right enough in thinking that I pity you.
But it is not so easy always to indulge one's self in that
luxury. It would be a mighty costly one if I were to
carry it to the length you ask. But I have a proposal
that may make it all right. There, listen coolly. Don't
cry, please! That quite unmans me. You can get out
of this trouble in an easy and pleasant way."</p>

<p>"Get out of this trouble?" repeated Sophia with hope
and joy. "Quick, tell me how!"</p>

<p>"So! I am ordered by Lieutenant Hide, who is second
in command over the Pixies, you know, to propose
marriage to you in the name of his oldest son Halfway."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are mocking me!" cried Sophia, clasping
her hands, and her countenance changing from hope to
horror. "You cannot mean that?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly I am not mocking," said Raft mistaking
her meaning; "he's in dead earnest, I am sure, and
will stand by his proposal. He means just what he
says. He wants a Brownie wife for his boy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Sir," exclaimed Sophia quickly, "you misunderstand
me. Nothing could induce me to listen a moment
to such a proposal. I would never, never marry him!"</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the way the wind blows, hey? Well,
there's no accounting for tastes. Young Halfway is
counted a likely chap, and the best match in the country.
There are scores of young Pixinees who would
jump at such an offer."</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it! It is an insult. I would die a
thousand deaths first. Never, never!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, you needn't go on so about it. I'm sure
I meant you no harm, and I've done my duty to my
captain. Hide can't gainsay that."</p>

<p>Sophia sank upon a cushion and wept violently. Raft
looked upon her tenderly. At last he spoke:</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Sophia, it may be that you'd take
more kindly to a sea life, now, than to one on shore. If
you can't marry Halfway, what do you say to Raft?
You will be free as air to come and go, and be queen of
the "Fringe," the fastest yacht upon the waters. You
shall have no captains or lieutenants over you, nor anything
else, but your own sweet will and choice. You
can visit your kin when you please, spend half the time
with them if you like. And, maybe, they would be
willing to have me spend a good deal of time with you
in the Brownie camp. P'raps I might take to Brownie
ways, by and by, and turn out a sort of fairy myself.
Who knows? What say you, my pretty? Speak up
and don't fear! If you'll give me the right to call you
my own, I can find the way out of this cave for you and
your friend Faith too, I'll be bound! Well, what is
it?"</p>

<p>Sophia's amazement during this address was unbounded.
She dropped her hands upon her lap, lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
her face and with round wondering eyes gazed in a bewildered
way upon the smuggler. Her heart had been
somewhat drawn toward Raft on account of his kindness.
The one glint of sunshine in all the deep darkness
and horror of their position, had been the rough courtesy
of this Pixie sailor. But to marry him? Oh! how
could she listen to such a proposal?</p>

<p>Yet she dared not stop Raft lest she should anger the
only one who had shown himself friendly. If she
should speak out her whole heart, would he not turn
against her and Faith with bitterness? Then, for just
one brief moment&mdash;the thought of her helplessness
flashed upon Sophia's mind. All was lost to them.
They were already as those who had gone down among
the tombs. Would it not be right for her to save Faith,
at least, by complying? Faith would be free!&mdash;Raft
had promised it. She herself might be delivered from
the power of Spite and Hide, who would compel her to
marry Halfway. True, she would be a Pixie's wife.
But how much better Raft than Halfway! How much
better to be free upon the Fringe, than imprisoned in
Dame Tigrina's halls? To be permitted to see home
and friends as often as she wished! Ought she not to
make the sacrifice, and save dear Faith?</p>

<p>The temptation flashed before her imagination for a
moment&mdash;only for a moment. With a shudder, and a
blush of self-reproach that she had even allowed the
thought to rise, she put the temptation aside.</p>

<p>"O Sir," she exclaimed, bursting into tears, "I pray
you say no more! You have showed me some kindness;
have pity on me now. I cannot do what you ask.
I am betrothed to Sergeant True. The laws of my race
would not allow a marriage with you or any other of
your people. Such concord, fellowship, and communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
we may never hold with Pixies. We dare not be thus
unequally yoked together. Indeed, I would not offend
you, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," exclaimed the smuggler interrupting her,
"there's no offence in particular. If you don't accept,
it's your own look out. However, I can do nothing for
you in that case. If you were my wife now, I should
have a right to protect you and yours against all my
kith and kin. I would do it, too! But as you don't
choose that, I must e'en stand by my employer, and do
the best I can for him. So, say no more about it.
There! the chief is ready to leave, I see, and so good-night!"</p>

<p>The two Pixies left the room, and Faith and Sophia
were once more alone. Their grief was pitiful to see.
There was not a ray of hope for them. O that they
were dead! or, that they had never been born! So they
moaned, and wept in each other's arms for long, long
hours, until Nature hushed their anguish into the forgetfulness
of sleep.</p>

<p>While the Pixie chief was off upon his mission of unrighteousness,
the Brownie captain had also gone upon
a journey. Leaving the command to MacWhirlie he
started for the mansion with Blythe and True. The
old Dutch clock in the hall rang out the hour of four
as they entered the chamber window by the Virginia
creeper that covered the side of the house. Night was
beginning to yield before the advance of coming day,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And now Aurora, daughter of the Dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How sweet, fresh and still the old place looked after
the trials, fatigues and perils of the past day and night!
But there was no time to indulge pleasant sentiment.
Many dear interests hung upon their haste. They crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
through the window blinds, and mounted the bed posts
to the coverlid close by the sleeping Governor.</p>

<p>Bruce spoke. Wille turned uneasily in his sleep, but
made no answer. Blythe touched his face with a sword
handle. The Governor threw up his hand, opened his
eyes, plucked at the netting of the canopy and muttered,</p>

<p>"I say, wife, the mosquitoes have got under the bar.
It's very annoying!" Then he lay down again to sleep.</p>

<p>Once more Bruce spoke, but more loudly, "Governor
Wille, Wille, Wille!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" sighed the sleeping man, "I do think
the everlasting singing of those mosquitoes is worse than
their bite. Couldn't you keep them out, wife?"</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Bruce impatiently, "It is we&mdash;the
Brownies. Wake up! Wake, and listen to us, if
you have any love or pity for your old friends."</p>

<p>Governor Wille was now aroused and sat up in his
bed and looked down sleepily upon his fairy friends.
He yawned and rubbed his eyes. "Well," he began,
"this is a strange visit, truly. What is wanted now,
pray?" Bruce briefly related the late events, and besought
his aid to recover the lost Nurses.</p>

<p>"But I don't see what I'm to do!" exclaimed Wille.
"How can I bring back the poor lasses? I don't know
where they are, I am sure. What shall I do about it?
I say, wife&mdash;wife! Dido, wake up! Here are the
Brownies. Spite has captured Faith and Sophia. Dear
me! can't you wake? You're a precious sleepy head!"</p>

<p>Dido awoke in half the time that Wille had taken; but
then gentlemen look at those things so differently when
it concerns their wives! Wille and Dido held a short
conference, which was interrupted by many yawns from
the Governor, and finally Dido announced the conclusion.</p>

<p>"Governor Willie has been up all night," she said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
"He returned at a late hour from Columbus, and is worn
out with business, travel and loss of sleep. He must
rest now. After breakfast we will go out to the lake
and join you in the search after Faith and Sophia."</p>

<p>"When do you breakfast?" asked Blythe.</p>

<p>"It will be quite late to-morrow&mdash;ten o'clock at least,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"And you will not be ready to help us before eleven
or twelve, then?"</p>

<p>"I think that is quite likely."</p>

<p>"Cannot you come without the Governor?" suggested
Blythe.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't think of that. We never undertake
such things separately. Good morning, now."</p>

<p>Dido pulled up her night-cap, retied the strings, and
laid her pretty head upon the pillow. Her husband was
already breathing heavily, off asleep while Dido was
talking.</p>

<p>"But, madam," said True earnestly, "twelve o'clock
may be too late. You are trifling with this thing! We
ask you to pity us and help us. You know the Golden
Motto, 'Quickly done is twice done.' If you want to
help us at all you must make haste."</p>

<p>"Hush-sh!" said Bruce, taking the Sergeant by the
arm and leading him away. "Don't you see? They are
both asleep already. We can do nothing more now, I
fear. Come, we must once more fall back upon our own
resources."</p>

<p>True left the bed unwillingly. He muttered and sent
back reproachful looks as he moved away. He may
have been too much interested to judge calmly, but he
had decided opinions about the conduct of Wille and
Dido&mdash;sleeping while Faith and Sophia were in Pixie
bonds! He spoke out, too. But his words were unheard.
The trio left the chamber and hastened back to camp.</p>

<p class="chapname">A BATTLE ON LAKE KATRINE.</p>


<p>Commodore Rodney and his brave tars were not long
in reaching the inlet, where the Brownie fleet lay moored.
The damages received in the last sea fight were so far
repaired that the ships were ready for service. Sails
were shaken out, cordage stretched, anchors weighed,
and before dawn the whole navy was crossing the lake

</div>

<p>Rodney's flag-ship was called the Emma, and was
built after designs of the
Brownie Naval Constructor.
Its hull was cunningly
framed from
leaves cut, bent and
stretched into proper
shape. Its sails were
delicate leaves fastened
upon miniature
masts, whose cordage
was twisted from fibres of plants. Its armament was
thus fashioned: bits of elderberry stalk were cut into
short lengths and the pith removed, leaving "barrels"
which were thrust out of port-holes or laid along deck.
A rod or "plunger" fitted into each barrel, the outer
end of which was lashed to a string tied to the ends of a
bowed strip of elastic wood, hickory for the most part,
whose ends were braced by stiff pieces to either side of
the barrel. To the end of the "plunger" several ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
were fastened. Then tiny pebbles were dropped into the
tubes against the head of the rod through holes in the
breech. To fire the gun, the Brownies drew the plunger
back as far as the elastic strip would allow; then suddenly
let go the cords, which the gun crew usually did
with a great hurrah. The bended strips sprung into
position, forcing the plunger forward, thus driving out
the pebbles to a goodly distance. For these cannons or
catapults the Brownies had the odd name of "davids."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 78.&mdash;A Brownie David (top view.)</span>
</div>

<p>The other vessels of the fleet were smaller than the
Emma, but were rigged and
fitted out after the same manner.
Their names are: the
Ken, commanded by Pipe;
the Trusty, commanded by
Waterborn; the Old Honest,
commanded by Tradewind;
the Perseverance, commanded
by Coral; the Hope, commander
Fluke; the Steady,
commander Temperance; the
Kind, commander Takeheed.
These were the principal vessels
and their captains were
good and tried men.</p>

<p>The Brownie national flag was white, with a blue
canton or field; upon the latter was a white cross saltier,
known as St. Andrew's Cross, within the centre of which
was a red flaming heart surrounded by a wreath of
thistle blooms and leaves. The Brownie "Jack," after
the fashion of American and British fleets, was simply
the blue field as above described, without the white fly.
Commodore Rodney's pennant was a white streamer,
bearing thereupon a white water lily, the long stem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
which was bent into the form of the letter "E," as used
in script, and the whole displayed upon a green leaf.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the tiny fleet, with sails
all set and colors flying, swiftly riding the water.
The current of the brook carried the boats well on
towards Ellen's Isle. Off the western point
of the island they left the stream and proceeded
slowly along the northern shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 79.&mdash;Brownie Flag and Pennant.</span>
</div>

<p>"Sail, ho!" cried the lookout on the foretopmast cross-trees
of the flag-ship.</p>

<p>"Where away?" asked Rodney.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead!"</p>

<p>"Hah! that's strange. What do you make her out
to be?"</p>

<p>"I can't say exactly, owing to the mist upon the
lake. But I take it to be the Styx, the flag-ship of the
Pixie squadron."</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp eye ahead," said Rodney. "The Styx
was anchored at the outlet last night and can hardly be
off there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see her plainly now!" said the lookout, "and she
is not alone, sir. Three other sails have just hove in
sight."</p>

<p>"It's the Pixie navy, then?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir. And they're standing up the channel
with every sail set."</p>

<p>"Strange!" muttered Rodney. "How did they know
of our movements? Is there a traitor among us? Is it
all chance? Or has this something to do with the loss
of my poor child? No matter! There the enemy is,
and we must make ready to receive him. Ho, there!
Make signal, prepare for action!"</p>

<p>The flag that telegraphed this order to the fleet was
run up, and soon the merry whistle piping the men to
quarters was heard upon deck. Little preparation was
needed. All were longing for the fray. Every heart
yearned to do somewhat to rescue the captured Nurses
and avenge the injury put upon their beloved commanders.
The sun had now fairly risen, and the mists
slowly rolled up from the surface of the lake. The whole
Pixie fleet was seen standing up the channel, as the strip
of water between the island and the orchard was called.
The wind was from the northwest and therefore favorable
to the Pixies, who were bearing down rapidly upon
the Brownies.</p>

<p>The vessels of the water-pixies are built in the same
style as Raft's yacht, the Fringe, but much larger in
size. Admiral Quench commanded the fleet, and the
names of his most important vessels, with their masters,
are as follows: the "By and By," Master Slipknot; the
"Despair," Master Strangle; the "Goodtime," Master
Drown; the "Littleone," Master Sineasy; the "Fast,"
Master Wildoats; the "Doubt," Master Shallow; the
"Smoke," Master Stunt; the "Cigarette," Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Sapforce, whose mate was Mr. Nicotine. More efficient
captains and crews never spread sail or drew cutlass.
They were devoted to their Admiral and thoroughly
united in hatred of the Brownies. They had the advantage
over their enemies in strength and number, and
with a favoring wind, were confident of victory.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_080-1.jpg" width="400" height="342" alt="Figs. 80, 81.&mdash;The Pixies&#39; Flag and Pennant." title="Figs. 80, 81.&mdash;The Pixies&#39; Flag and Pennant." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 80, 81.&mdash;The Pixies&#39; Flag and Pennant.</span>
</div>

<p>The Pixie sailors were popularly known (after the
name of their flag-ship)
as the "Stygians."
The Brownie
tars had also a popular
name,&mdash;"Natties,"
which, unless it be a
nickname for "navigators,"
the author
knows not the meaning
thereof.</p>

<p>As the two fleets
rapidly neared each
other a red silken flag
was run up to the peak
of the Styx. It showed on a black canton, embroidered
in white silk, a round spider web within which hung a
skull and cross-bones. Admiral Quench also had his
pennant, a red streamer upon which was blazoned a
golden chalice held inverted in a sable hand over burning
coals.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Brownies the wind chopped
around into the north just as the two fleets came within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
gun shot. The advantage in man[oe]uvring, which before
had been wholly with the Stygians, was now equally
divided. As the black and red flag floated from the
peak of the Styx, the Natties opened fire with their
davids. The pebbles tore through the sails of the Pixie
ships and wrought much damage among the crews.</p>

<p>"Close up!" telegraphed Quench from the flag-ship.</p>

<p>Stygians prefer to fight at close quarters. They have
no weapons like the Brownie davids, fit for doing battle
at long range, and therefore bear straight down upon the
enemy; fling out from their spinnerets grapnels of silk
cable; leap upon the enemy's deck and with fangs,
swords, spears, and lassoes fairly weigh down and overpower
their foes. A company of trained boarders
known as the Vaulters, commanded by one Saltus, were
especially formidable. Their duty was to station themselves
upon a yard-arm, cross-trees, top or shroud, and
attach their bodies thereto by elastic ropes; thence they
would leap down upon their foe, seize him, and by the
backward rebound of the cord, draw him with themselves
up to the point of departure. When thus seized
and carried aloft a Brownie rarely escaped.</p>

<p>The sudden change of wind enabled the Natties to
keep clear of their powerful adversaries. They tacked
back and forth across the channel, avoided the Pixie
ships and poured in at long range their david shot.
Rodney, however, had no thought of shunning a hand
to hand fight. He had determined upon a decisive
struggle. He believed that his Natties in their present
humor would be invincible. Having therefore pounded
the Stygians thoroughly with his davids, and thus disabled
one or two ships and weakened several crews,
he hoisted the signal "Bring the enemy to close
action!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>The order was received with cheers and briskly
obeyed. The Natties bore down upon the enemy and
poured in volley after volley of shot. The Stygian sails
were riddled, masts were knocked over, decks were
covered with wounded Pixies; splinters flew in the air
like snow flakes.</p>

<p>The fleets were now within grappling distance. The
two parties stood with weapons drawn, eager for the meeting
that should test their courage, skill and strength. The
ships closed. Hull grated upon hull; yards interlocked;
the grapnels were hove; ship to ship, all along the line,
Stygians and Natties were coupled in conflict. The
Kind and Tattle, the Trusty and Fast, the Hope and
Despair, the Old Honest and the Littleone, the Perseverance
and the By and By, the Ken and the Doubt,
were locked together. The Tipple and the Treat were
both alongside the Steady, the Smoke and Cigarette were
doubled against the Wholesome, and the Styx and Goodtime
had grappled the Emma.</p>

<p>In some cases the Natties were the boarder, in others
the Stygians. The better policy of the Brownies was to
stand upon the defensive in these hand to hand fights;
for the network of cords and ropes with which the
rigging and decks of the Pixie craft were filled, made
it perilous for Brownies to land upon them. There were
some, however, bold enough or rash enough to venture,
and not always without success.</p>

<p>The Emma was somewhat larger than the flag-ship of
the Pixie squadron; but as the Styx was aided by the
Goodtime in the assault upon her, Rodney had heavy
odds against him. Yet he and his brave tars were so
thoroughly wrought up and eager for battle that he
cared nought for that. He bade his crew stand by to
repel boarders. They were ranged on either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
deck. Admiral Quench brought up the Styx on the
port side. The Stygians swarmed in the rigging. They
hung upon the yards, which projected over the Emma's
deck, ready to drop down thereupon. They flung out
their lariats to entangle the Natties stationed on yards
and ratlines.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 301px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 82.&mdash;The Brownie &quot;Jack,&quot; Blue Field, White Saltier, Red Flaming Heart, the Flames of Gold.</span>
</div>

<p>Arrows flew in clouds from the Emma's deck and
rigging. Then
casting aside their
bows (all except
the sharpshooters
stationed in the
top), the Brownie
sailors closed to
their work. The
battle had begun
in earnest. For a
few moments there
was a confused
mingling of Stygians
and Natties.
Brownie cheers
blended with the rasping clatter of the Pixies' drum
beaten by Stridulans and his drum corps. A constant
splash&mdash;splashing was heard, as pairs of combatants
dropped from the shrouds into the lake, where
the battle was often renewed, both parties sometimes
sinking together in death.</p>

<p>As yet no Stygian had kept foot upon the Emma.
Every onset had been repulsed and the Pixies hurled
back. But the Brownies were not always to be so
fortunate. A strong party headed by Quench broke
through the line of defenders, and fairly got foothold
upon the Emma. In the confusion Master Drown led a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
vigorous attack from the Goodtime, and gained a footing
in the starboard waist. For a moment the Natties gave
way. Victory seemed to woo the Stygians, who were
pressing upon their enemies, exultingly shouting their
watchword, "Death!"</p>

<p>In this crisis, Commodore Rodney raised the Brownie
war cry. "Rescue, rescue!" he shouted; "Remember
Faith! Remember Sophia! To the Rescue! Follow
me!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_083.jpg" width="300" height="281" alt="Fig. 83.&mdash;Flag of Brownie Brigade of Cavalry, Blue and Gold." title="Fig. 83.&mdash;Flag of Brownie Brigade of Cavalry, Blue and Gold." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 83.&mdash;Flag of Brownie Brigade of Cavalry, Blue and Gold.</span>
</div>

<p>He ran upon the advancing line of Stygians swinging
his cutlass above his head. It was a Damascus
blade, a famous weapon in the Brownie history
and traditions,
which went by the
name of "Straight."
The commander of
the Emma, Captain
Ask, advanced
side by side with
the Commodore.
His voice was
heard above the
clamor of battle and discord of Pixie drums
echoing the call "Rescue!" as he poised aloft his battle-axe,
the "Bigbelief" as his sailors used to call it.
Rodney's sword and the battle-axe of Ask cut great
gaps in the Stygian ranks. The Natties followed close
upon their leaders, and soon the Pixies were driven back
again to the sides of the ship.</p>

<p>There they made a stand. In the drift and swirl of
the conflict it happened that the leaders of the contending
crews were brought face to face. Admiral Quench
had steadily fought his way toward Captain Ask; Ask
had as eagerly pressed toward the spot where Quench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
was fighting. They met at last. Quench flung upon
the Captain's face and arms a cloud of network. The
delicate threads, striking like a lasso against Ask's upraised
arm, enveloped it, and the enswathed member
sank helpless at his side.<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> His eyes were filled with the
silken filaments, so that he was well-nigh blinded. A
mocking laugh broke from Quench's lips as he leaped
forward upon his foe with out-reached fangs.</p>

<p>It would have gone hard with Captain Ask had not
the mate of his ship, whose name was Angel, been close
behind him. He had followed and guarded his beloved
commander throughout the entire battle. Quickly the
mate cut the network that bound Ask's arm, tore the
filaments from his eyes and dashed his own cutlass into
Quench's face. The Pixie paused a moment, staggered
by the blow. In that moment Ask recovered himself,
raised his axe and struck the Admiral. His aim was
somewhat turned aside by the web filaments, still clinging
to his arm. The blade of Bigbelief missed the
Pixie's head and sank into his shoulder. The force of
the blow carried both combatants to the deck. Ask
rose to his feet, seized Quench in his arms, lifted him up,
put forth all his strength and threw him into the lake.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rodney had come upon Drown, the master
of the Goodtime. The fight between the two was short
and decided. Drown was pinned to the mast head by
the Commodore's sword; Rodney's left arm was severely
wounded, and his face badly torn. Before he could
withdraw his sword a score of Stygians led by Deceit,
the master of the Styx, set upon him. Natties hastened
to the rescue, and waged battle gallantly around their
chief. Rodney seized a marlinspike, for he had no time
to withdraw his cutlass, and with his unwounded arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
laid about him vigorously. Deceit fought his way
through the line of Natties until he reached the mast
whereto his comrade, Master Drown, was pinned like an
insect in an entomologist's box. He drew forth the cutlass,
and was about taking Drown in his arms when
Rodney fell upon him. Deceit turned the cutlass
against its owner. But it was an awkward weapon in
the new hands and did little hurt. A blow from the
marlinspike broke the Stygian captain's arm and sent
the cutlass ringing upon deck. Deceit closed immediately
upon Rodney, seized him with his uninjured
claws, and ere the Commodore could again raise his arm,
bore him to the bulwark of the ship, mounted the rail,
and was about to leap into the water with his captive.
Fortunately, Rodney with his right hand laid hold upon
the shrouds and thus delayed for an instant the Pixie's
fell purpose. A volunteer sailor in the Emma's crew,
our old friend Sergeant Clearview, had picked up the
Commodore's cutlass as it dropped from Deceit's hand.
He was at Rodney's side in a moment. He clasped one
arm around the chief as he hung over the rail, and with
the other buried the blade of Straight in the bosom of
Deceit.</p>

<p>The Stygian captain loosed his hold, fell back into the
lake and sank out of sight. A dozen willing hands had
by this time seized the Commodore, and he was borne
fainting to his cabin. Thus it happened that two of the
chief officers of the Brownie navy owed their safety,
that day, to the prompt and loving aid of their followers.</p>

<p>We left Quench struggling in the lake whither Ask
had tossed him. This was a small matter to the Stygian
admiral, for he was a famous swimmer, and disabled as
he was, had no trouble in reaching his own ship's side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
He clambered up the man ropes and was helped aboard
by his sailors.</p>

<p>"Cut adrift," were his first words, "and signal the
same to the fleet!"</p>

<p>So cut adrift it was, on board the Styx and Goodtime
not only, but throughout the squadron. Had Rodney
not been disabled, it is doubtful whether the Stygian
ships would have got off from the Emma so easily. As
it was, they were suffered to swing loose, but were not
permitted to leave without some parting compliments.</p>

<p>"Man the guns!" cried Ask. The Natties stood to
their davids, and shot rattled upon the retreating ships
so freely that the crews were driven below, leaving on
deck only enough to navigate the vessels.</p>

<p>Throughout the two squadrons various fortunes befell
the ships. The Steady had fared somewhat worse
than the Emma. Commander Temperance was badly
wounded, and had not the signal to cut adrift been given
in the very niche of time, the good ship might have
been captured. The Wholesome was badly damaged by
the Cigarette and Smoke, and her captain, Lustyhealth,
was carried below sorely hurt. One of the Stygian
vessels, the Despair, was sunk by the Hope. Its captain,
Master Strangle, got off on one of the boats, however,
much to the sorrow of Commander Fluke who tried
hard to lay hold of the rogue. The Tattle was captured
along with its master, Backbite, by Commander Takeheed
of the Kind. This miserable, sneaking Pixie was
lashed to a mast of his own ship, and as the Kind towed
the Tattle through the Brownie fleet he was greeted
everywhere with groans and jeers by the true-hearted
sailors. They were not used to treat prisoners after this
fashion, but had small compunction in the case of this
fellow Backbite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the rest of the ships, it must be enough to say
that all the officers and crews did their duty well.
Special mention may be made of Boatswain Pipe. Even
before the signal to cut adrift had been hoisted upon the
Pixie flag-ship, Pipe had so closely pressed the Doubt,
that its master, Captain Shallow, had already cut off his
grapnels, and was in full flight toward Big Cave Harbor.</p>

<p>The Ken followed peppering her adversary with david
shot. But Pipe soon saw that the Doubt would slip
away from him, and gave up the pursuit, returned to the
fight, ran his ship alongside the Despair, leaped upon
her deck at the head of his boarders, and fell upon the
crew who were engaged with the Hope. It was through
this timely reinforcement and the bravery of Pipe the
Boatswain that Commander Fluke was able to sink the
Despair with all her crew, excepting the boat's crew that
escaped with Captain Strangle to the Tipple. Having
finished this valiant service, he pulled away in an open
boat to the aid of the Wholesome, and by his timely
reinforcement saved that craft from the clutch of Captains
Stunt and Nicotine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="chapname">A NAVAL MONSTER.</p>


<p>While these exciting events were occurring, Twadeils
and his chums having finished their "lark" were slowly
picking their way towards the Brownie camp with their
prisoners and wounded comrade. It was past sun-up
before they sighted the pickets, for a heavy fog having
arisen from the lake, they must needs stop and wait for
the day. At the guard line they were halted only a few
moments, but taken at once to headquarters, where they
told their news in full, and turned over their prisoners.
Thence they were marched away to the guard house
where, after a hearty breakfast, they turned in for a
sound sleep. They were quite content to take their
punishment, and happy that their adventure had turned
out so much better than they had dared to hope. Halfrick,
who had been sent to the hospital, rapidly improved,
and it may here be said, fully recovered under
the Nurses' skillful care. When the party learned the
unhappy fate of Faith and Sophia they were deeply
grieved.</p>

<p>"I saw the lights of the searchers at one time," said
Gear, "bobbing here and there through the bushes; but
I was fool enough to think that it was a guard detail
out looking for us, and so said nothing. Alas, alas!
Well, I don't believe I'll ever go on another lark!"
But he forgot his good resolve before long, and the time
came when he was as keen for a night adventure as ever
he had been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the morning the whole party, amid the mingled
cheers and chaff of the camp were brought before Captain
Bruce who had returned from his visit to Governor
Wille.</p>

<p>"Brownies," he said, "you have been guilty of a
serious breach of discipline by leaving the camp without
orders, and that in the face of the enemy. It is true,
you have done great public service; but that has been
more by good luck than good management or good
intent. The result might have been different, and not
only damaging to the Nation, but fatal to yourselves.
You deserve a greater punishment than you have received;
but this is a time of sore grief and peril to our
Nation, in which the best service of all her sons is
required for every moment. I therefore dismiss you
with this public reprimand and the imprisonment already
inflicted. Remember that no deeds, however brave, can
entitle one to praise when they are done in defiance of
discipline, and in disobedience of superiors. Go; report
to your several commands, and henceforth confine your
energies to the discharge of regular duty and obedience
of lawful orders."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you were a little too severe with the
boys, father?" asked Agatha, who was present during
the reprimand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was, daughter; but I hardly think so.
Some kinds of craft will bear a good deal of ballast.
But all our young Brownies are alike; they will have
their freaks and larks no matter how serious affairs may
be. However, these lads are among the most skillful
soldiers in camp, and they will be none the worse either
for their fun or their punishment. The rogues! What
a lark it was!" And in spite of the heavy burden
on his heart, he smiled at the remembrance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
adventures which had been told
him. "It seems the climax of
absurdity that a mere squad of
youngsters should plan an
assault upon a strong fort, and
actually gain possession of it too,
by a freak of fortune!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 154px;">
<img src="images/fig_084.jpg" width="154" height="600"
alt="Fig. 84.&mdash;&quot;They Entered the Leafy Towers.&quot;"
title="Fig. 84.&mdash;&quot;They Entered the Leafy Towers.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 84.&mdash;&quot;They Entered the Leafy Towers.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Now orders were given to raze
the empty fort. The Brownies
had been keen to enter and
destroy the place as soon as
Twadeils had reported its abandonment;
but MacWhirlie forbade
action until Captain Bruce's
return. The eager soldiers
swarmed over the barricades,
through the gates, and along the
vacant streets. They entered the
leafy towers in search of lurking
foemen, and finding none cut
the binding threads and let the
leaves unroll. They severed the
stay ropes of the conning tower
of Pixie Thaddeus, and the
whole structure collapsed. As
the repaired suspension bridge
stood intact, and the shore was
strewn with the litter of a hasty
flight, the manner of the Pixies'
escape was easily explained.
But the whereabouts of the garrison
was not made out on
account of the fog that overhung
the lake. That however was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
lifting, and the Pixie fleet would soon be in sight.
The soldiers went to work heartily. Breastworks, barricades,
gates, towers, walls, ramparts, bridge and piers
were assailed with such zeal and vigor, that in a short
time the remnants of Fort Spinder were laid in pieces
upon the ground, flying in fragments through the air,
or floating in broken bits
upon the water.</p>

<p>By the time this good work
was finished the sun had
scattered the fog, and left the
face of the lake quite clear.
Little columns and clouds of
mist still hung here and
there, leaving distant objects
indistinct, but both fleets were
in sight. The Brownies crowded
down to the bank, and from every
elevation and tree top watched the
battle. The Stygians pushing out of
Big Cave Harbor, and the Natties
coming into sight around the foot of
the island; the man[oe]uvring of the
vessels under the change of wind;
the effect of the davids upon the
Pixie craft; the onset, the closing
together of the ships, the grappling
of hull to hull, all these events the
excited soldiers saw. After that, the
two fleets were so huddled together that none could say
which side was victorious.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of the cavalry mounted and pushed off over the
lake to see for themselves. But the Bee and Butterfly
ponies dared not come very near the ships, lest their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
wings should be caught in the rigging and they and
their riders destroyed. They came close enough, however,
to notice the turn of battle. Couriers passed
back and forth bringing to Bruce news, now good now
bad. At last they reported the Stygians in full retreat,
and that the Natties had gained a great victory. Cheer
upon cheer greeted this tidings. The shouts from the
shore rolled across the water, and were heard by the
Brownie sailors who answered their comrades heartily.</p>

<p>A yacht was dispatched for Captain Bruce, who, accompanied
by Blythe and True, crossed to the Emma to
consult with Rodney as to future movements. The
Stygians had retired to Big Cave Harbor, and there for
some time they were likely to stay. They could be seen
from the fore-top busy upon deck and rigging repairing
the damages of battle, as the Natties, also, were doing.
Dinner was now over; a pleasant hum of voices sounded
through the fleet. The decks were cleaned from the
litter of conflict. The sad rites over their fallen comrades
were decently but speedily paid. The sailors
awaited eagerly the issue of the officers' consultation.</p>

<p>Captain Bruce returned to the shore. Blythe and
True remained with the fleet, and were assigned to the
Ken under care of Pipe the Boatswain. Now a rumor
ran through the squadron that an immediate attack was
to be made upon the Stygians by the whole Brownie
brigade; that MacWhirlie had gone around with the
cavalry by the inlet to fall upon the Pixie camp, and
that Bruce with the infantry was to pass around to the
other end of the lake, cross the outlet and cut off retreat
from that quarter. However set agoing, the rumor well
set forth the main features of the plan agreed upon
between army and navy.</p>

<p>Rodney's wound was painful, but was not so serious as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to hinder active service. He went about his duties with
his arm slung in bandages; a little weak in body, but as
stout of heart as ever, and with brighter hopes than he
had for some time dared to cherish. The afternoon was
well advanced when the lookout on the Emma reported
an unusual movement in the Pixie fleet.</p>

<p>"What do you make it out?" said Rodney.</p>

<p>"They seem to be getting ready to weigh anchor!"
answered the lookout. "And several of their boats
have in tow a queer sort of craft that looks more like a
snail shell than any sort of vessel I know."</p>

<p>"Hah! some Pixie trick, I warrant!" returned Rodney.
"But we mustn't let them escape us this time. Ho
there! Set the signal to weigh anchor."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir," was the hearty response from Mate
Angel. "It is done, Sir."</p>

<p>"Now signal the fleet to prepare for action."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir. That is done too."</p>

<p>"Good. Now set the order to come to close quarters."</p>

<p>"Close quarters it is, Sir," soon responded the prompt
mate.</p>

<p>The Nattie ships were bearing down upon the mouth
of Big Cave Harbor, arranged in the form of a half
moon, the Emma in the centre of the line. Pipe led
one wing in the Ken, Commander Coral led the other
in the Perseverance. Already the cavalry battalion
had made the crossing, and was well up to the Pixie
camp, close along shore, and almost within hailing distance
of the fleet. A squad under command of Ensign
Lawe was left to guard the shore road and make telegraphic
signals to the fleet with the wigwag flags. Lieutenant
MacWhirlie with the bulk of the troops pushed
on and to the rear, with the purpose of falling upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Pixie camp while the fleet attacked in front. The odd
looking craft which had puzzled the lookout, had been
towed off shore, and was now slowly gliding out of the
harbor. The Stygians were seen from the Brownie ships
hanging
in the
rigging,
manning
the tops,
swarming
at their
quarters upon
deck, evidently
ready for action.</p>

<p>But not an
anchor was
raised, not a vessel
stirred. The
crews stood dumb and
motionless, with eyes
turned toward that
strange craft bearing
down steadily upon the
Brownie vessels.</p>

<p>"What can it be?"
queried the Brownies.</p>

<p>Nobody knew. No
sail, nor mast, nor spar,
nor rigging of any kind
was to be seen upon it.
Not a sailor showed
himself anywhere. It
had no visible motive power, and went through the water
as though driven by an unseen spirit hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can it be?" exclaimed Pipe, whose command
lay nearest the strange vessel.</p>

<p>"I believe it is the new ram the
Pixies have been talking so much
about lately," answered Sergeant
True. "They have been trying to keep
it a secret, but the thing has leaked
out. It looks like an ugly affair."</p>

<p>"Ugly? I should say so!" said
the old salt warmly. "It is nothing
but the cast off shell of a water snail.
Call that seamanship? Nobody but a
lubber or a Pixie would be willing to
sail or fight in such a tub as that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm only a lubber, you
know," answered True, "and have
but a landsman's notion of things.
But to my mind that ram, or shell, or
tub or whatever it may be, will turn
the tide of battle against us if we
don't look out. See! the davids are
playing on it from all parts of our
fleet. The shot bounds off its sides
like thistle-down. It keeps straight
on its way, like grim Fate, turning
neither to the right hand nor the left.
Do you see, Boatswain? the creature
is making straight for us!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye! let it come on. I say
pooh! to all your croaking. Stand
by, now, and see how a genuine sailor
can knock the bottom out of all the
floating brass, iron, or snail-shell pots
that ever went to sea. Launch the boats, lads! We'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
pull up to this Stygian kettle and see if we can't find
some hole in it through which our cutlasses will make
way."</p>

<p>Next to the Ken was the captured Pixie ship Tattle,
which had been turned into the Brownie navy with the
new name Praise, and Clearview, as a reward for his
service in saving Rodney's life, had been promoted to
command her. Next to the Praise was the Hope, Commander
Fluke. As the Pixie ram neared the left wing,
composed of the three vessels just named, it suddenly
shifted its course and bore straight down upon the Praise.</p>

<p>"Fire!" cried Clearview. A harmless broadside was
poured upon the Ram.</p>

<p>"Again," shouted Clearview. "Aim below the water
line; I see an opening there."</p>

<p>Another broadside was delivered with no better effect.
On, on the weird monster moved, straight toward the
ship. Every eye in both fleets was fixed upon the Praise.
Every heart throbbed with anxiety.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>A groan of dismay ran along the line of the Brownie
squadron. A wild yell of joy rose from the Pixie ships.
The solid prow of the ram had crushed through the
leafy side of the Praise, as an iron steamship would run
through a fishing schooner. She sank in a moment
leaving her crew struggling in the waves.</p>

<p>More quickly than one would have thought so clumsy
a craft could move, the Ram turned and bore down
upon the Hope. The Natties aboard this ship were dismayed
at the fate of their comrades, but not a man
swerved from his post.</p>

<p>"Boarders, ahoy!" shouted Fluke.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Prepare to board the enemy. Drop from the cross-trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Spring from the deck. Heave the grapnels if
you can."</p>

<p>Brave but hopeless struggle! The Ram crushed into
the Hope as into the Praise. A few of the Natties succeeded
in leaping upon the smooth round turret of the
enemy, only to roll off again into the lake, and be engulfed
in the vortex of their sinking ship.</p>

<p>Two ships gone in a score of minutes! No wonder
the Brownies began to get ready to bout ship and flee
from this leviathan of the deep who devoured ships as
behemoth the rivers. No wonder that Pipe, when he
saw two-thirds of his command swept out of existence,
should have felt a cold shudder run through him as this
invincible and invulnerable mystery of the sea now
turned its prow upon him. His order to launch boats
had been executed. The three ship boats were already
in the water. Pipe himself commanded one, True another,
Coxswain Help the third. Lieutenant Swift had
charge of the ship. Pipe hesitated only a moment as to
what he should do.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," he said, "look out for the ship. Tack,
and if you can, get to the stern of the old kettle." He
held to his prejudice even after such sad experiences.
"You may find some joint in her harness there through
which to send a shot. But look out for the ship, and
save her whatever comes of us. Ready, my hearties?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" was the firm response.</p>

<p>"Give way, then&mdash;lively!"</p>

<p>The three boats fairly cut the water. Pipe was in
advance. He tried to run his boat under the starboard
side, hoping to find some port-hole or opening there.
But his purpose was foiled. The Ram struck him amidships.
The boat was cut in two, and the crew submerged
in the waters. True's boat was just in the rear of Pipe's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and shared the same fate. Help, more fortunate than
the others, avoided the blow, and passed to the stern of
the Ram, which plowed on remorselessly and mutely as
before, directing its course against the Ken. Help threw
a quick glance upwards toward the strange vessel as it
surged by his boat. A curtain of varnished silk canvas
hung across the stern. It was drawn tight and fastened
above, below and at the side so that the water was shut
out. But Help saw one side of the curtain pushed back
for a moment, and the mocking visage of a well-known
Pixie officer peered out upon him. It closed, and the
Ram sped on to its work of destruction.</p>

<p>Help dropped into its wake, checked his boat, and
began looking about for any of the crews of the lost
boats and ships who might yet be above water. True
and Blythe were picked up. Clearview was saved.
Fluke was lost. Several others, common sailors, were
also picked up. But Pipe, good, gallant, dear old Pipe,
was gone! He had sunk and had not risen. For a
long time Help rowed around the scene of the disaster,
and then with a sad heart turned the bow of his
boat toward Ellen's Isle. The sturdy Natties brushed
from their eyes the tears shed over the lost boatswain,
and then bent to their oars, leaving their beloved Captain
beneath the waves of Lake Katrine. Of all the
gallant sailors who went down that day none was so
mourned as Pipe the Boatswain. The tragedy of his
taking off seemed all the more terrible because of the
untimely fate of his child Sophia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="chapname">THE CHARGE OF ENSIGN LAWE.</p>


<p>Lieutenant Swift felt bound by the orders of his late
commander, all the more because of his sad fate.
Accordingly he tacked ship, and avoided the stroke of
the Ram, which in turn tacked, though somewhat more
clumsily, and followed the Ken toward the Brownie
fleet. Again Swift tacked and put the head of his ship
toward Ellen's Isle. Then the Ram gave up the Ken
and bore down upon the Emma, as though resolved to
seal the fortunes of the fight with the destruction of
the Brownie flag-ship.</p>

<p>Rodney was in sore straits. His officers and crew were
greatly demoralized. His sailors were superstitious; and
there was something so contrary to all that Natties had
ever known or heard of in the character and exploits of
this audacious stranger, that superstition was aroused.
They could fight Pixies, but this was a sea-ghost. There
was no use contending against it. There was nothing to
do but bout ship and sail away. But what humiliation!
And after so noble a victory! To add to the perils of
the position, the Stygian ships had weighed anchor, and
were closing upon the Brownie fleet hard in the wake of
their Ram. At last duty overcame pride in Rodney's
heart, and he gave the order to retire up the channel.</p>

<p>Ensign Lawe, with his squad of cavalry, had watched
from a knoll on the lake shore the progress of events.
His heart sunk within him as he saw the loss of the
Brownie ships and crews. "I can't stand this any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
longer," he cried, as the boats of Pipe and True sank
before the Ram's stroke. "To the rescue, my lads!
Charge!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 132px;">

</div>

<p>Without waiting to see whether or no he was followed
by his battalion, he mounted his bee
pony and rode at full speed toward
the Ram. His troopers followed, muttering
loudly against their leader's
folly, but unwilling to disobey. The
Pixies saw him plunging through the
air, and greeted him with loud yells
of mockery.</p>

<p>"What is Lawe about?" asked
Rodney.</p>

<p>"It looks as though he were minded
to charge upon the sea monster," answered
the mate.</p>

<p>"What folly! Why, look there!
the madcap is charging almost alone
upon the very front of the Ram! He
is gone daft! Are you sure that is
Ensign Lawe? I never knew him to
do such an insane act. He is one of
the coolest heads we have. It's too
bad&mdash;too bad! The fellow is throwing
away his life; and we've lost too
many valuable officers already."
Rodney sighed, and thought of his
lost boatswain, the very right arm
of his fleet.</p>

<p>The Ram was steadily pursuing the
Nattie ships now in full retreat. The
wind blew up the channel. It would be a stern chase,
which is always a long chase. Half the Pixie navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
followed with the Ram; the other half had tacked
across the lake toward the foot of the island, with the
intention of sailing up the opposite channel, and thus
heading off the Natties ere they reached the inlet. They
had bold plans afoot, and thought to destroy the whole
Brownie fleet.</p>

<p>This man[oe]uvre had turned attention from the daring
ride of Ensign Lawe. Yet the Ensign was not such a
madcap as his countrymen declared him, nor such a fool
as his foes supposed. He had seen at once that the
masts and rigging usual to sailing vessels were wanting
from this new craft; he could therefore approach a-horseback
with comparative safety. That there must
be some assailable point, some port-hole, some door,
something penetrable he felt sure.</p>

<p>"I will find my way to it," he said in his heart; "or
at least find out where it is. I will uncover the secret
power that works this destruction, or find out the monster's
weak points and give knowledge of it to the
Commodore."</p>

<p>He had now reached the Ram. He swept above the
prow. No opening there! He hovered over the deck.
All hard and smooth there! He skimmed along the
sides. No port-holes, no seams, no sign of break or
opening there. He flew past the side, and hung in the
air above the vessel's stern. A dart whistled by his
face. He felt the vibrations of the air on his cheek.</p>

<p>"Hah! There is an opening then in your solid shell?
That dart came from some vent. Let us see!"</p>

<p>He pressed his gallant nag closer to the Ram. His
keen eye caught the varnished curtain that hung across
the stern. He saw one side of it tremble and lift a little
as he circled about it. The weak point in the sea monster
was exposed! Hurrah! He would try the metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of a Brownie cutlass against that varnished curtain!
If he could cut that open, the waves would rush into
the hull, and the Ram would sink into the lake with
the noble barks that it had destroyed.</p>

<p>Lawe tightened his bridle reins as he thus meditated,
and drew his cutlass. He dropped a little astern of the
Ram, but well to the port side, so that he might sweep
straight across the stern. He poised himself firmly, bent
over in the saddle, and cried, "Go, my good nag!"</p>

<p>Golden Rule, as his pony was named, sprang to the
voice of his master as though conscious of what depended
upon him. He passed across the stern of the Ram so
closely that his wings almost touched it.</p>

<p>Whi&mdash;rr&mdash;rr!</p>

<p>The Ensign's sword ripped through the curtain, and
Golden Rule shot by like an arrow.</p>

<p>Quickly Lawe turned and swept back again on the
same track. Again the blade cut through the curtain,
with a downward stroke this time that laid open a
vertical seam.</p>

<p>"Once more, my brave Golden!" said the Ensign,
patting his pony, and he swept the third time across
the face of the curtained door. The top and both edges
were now severed from the sides of the shell. The
curtain dropped over so that one corner dragged in the
water. The hollow hull of the shell ship was exposed,
and within it the angry faces of a group of Pixies.</p>

<p>The work wanted yet the finishing stroke. One side
of the curtain was slit down to the water line. The
waves were already washing in thereat; but the other
side was only partly severed. It needed one stroke
more&mdash;just one! That would lay the curtain level
with the lake; then the billows would roll in, and
claim the Pixies and their infernal machine for their own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>A fourth time Lawe swept across the stern of the Ram.
A fourth time his good sword did its work without fail.
The true eye and steady hand of the Ensign sent it
home to the mark. The curtain trembled a moment
in the breeze, fell backward with flap and splash upon
the surface of the lake, and dragged behind, checking
the Ram's motion as though it were a heavy anchor,
and then weighed the stern downward to the surface.
The waves broke in with a roar that echoed through
the hollow hull. The groans and yells of the Pixie
crew answered back the voice of the waters.</p>

<p>Lawe cast one exulting glance within as he rode
by. But he was doomed to a more terrible trial than
he had yet endured. As he sped across the opening on
his fourth trip, a dark form leaped upon him from the
hold. He was in a Pixie's clutch! One claw grasped
the Ensign's foot, the other was buried deep in Golden
Rule's breast. The pony, frantic with terror and pain,
plunged and shook his wings. But the Pixie kept
his hold. Lawe looked downward into his face. He
saw the black visage, and sneaking eyes of Lieutenant
Hide!</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," laughed the Pixie. "You know me, do
you? Well, you've done a fine thing to-day, no doubt!
Your name shall go down to posterity, of course. But
I think I shall stop <i>you</i> from going down any further
in that line. We shall try another sort of going down.
There's nothing like pleasant company, even when
one's making a voyage to the bottom of the lake! Ha,
ha!"</p>

<p>The malignant creature spoke truly. They were sinking
slowly together, horse, rider and Pixie into the lake.
The weight of Hide's body might have been overcome,
but the motion of the pony's wings was much hindered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Golden Rule struggled nobly, but fell steadily toward
the water. Ensign Lawe had by this time recovered
from the shock of the unexpected assault.</p>

<p>"Grammercy, for thy courteous invitation," he said,
coolly. "I choose to decline thy bidding and thy presence.
In sooth, we shall part company now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Boy&#39;s Illustration.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 92.&mdash;The Sinking of the Pixie Ram.</span>
</div>

<p>Once, twice, and again the faithful cutlass glanced in
the sunlight. The first stroke cut loose the Pixie's
claw from the pony's breast; the second divided the
arm by which his own foot was held; the third, following
quickly, smote upon the head of the wretched creature
as he tumbled, like Lucifer of old, into the bosom
of the lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a ripple upon the water; a faint pool of
blood tinged the face of Lake Katrine, and the waves
closed forever above the dead body of Hide, the son
of Shame. Golden Rule, released from his burden,
shook his wings gladly and mounted aloft. Lawe cast
his eyes downward just as the Pixie Ram settled, surged,
and plunged stern foremost into the lake.</p>

<p>Thus perished at the hands of Ensign Lawe, the
famous sea ghost, the Pixie shell-clad Ram. The machine
was a brilliant thought, the conception of Hide
himself. It was just what it seemed to be, the shell of a
water snail. Entering this empty shell, Hide and his
engineers had closed the opening with a web or curtain
of varnished silk, which kept the water out.<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> Then
paddles were fitted up in the stern, revolved by hand
cranks within, and thus the vessel was directed by those
inside. To ordinary assault it was invulnerable at every
part except the curtain which covered the opening, and
thereat had the keen blade of Ensign Lawe found
entrance, and so the way to victory.</p>

<p class="chapname">"HAIR-BREADTH 'SCAPES BY FLOOD AND FIELD."</p>


<p>The gallant exploit of Ensign Lawe had been wrought
while the two fleets were under full headway up the
channel. After the first outbreak of anxiety, amazement
and mockery, but little attention had been paid
the Quixotic affair, as all voted it. Both fleets were intent
upon the management of their ships. Pursuers and
pursued crowded on all sail, and as a strong wind blew
from the west they were a long way from the Ram at the
moment of its destruction. A shout from Lawe's soldiers,
who had hovered near during the strange duel,
drew attention to the Brownie troopers.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Rodney of the lookout.</p>

<p>"I don't see yet. Yes, I make it out now; Lawe is
struggling in the air with a Pixie who must have leaped
from the Ram upon his pony. The Ensign is falling
into the water. No! he has cut himself loose! The
troopers wave their swords and shout like mad men."</p>

<p>"What of the Ram? How do the lads manage to
escape the darts from the&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"See! See!" cried the lookout excitedly. "The
Ram is settling into the water. The stern has been laid
open from deck to keel. The waves rush in. She is
sinking! Hurrah, hurrah!" The national standard
was run up upon the flag-ship, and as the Natties uncovered
and saluted the colors, cheer after cheer made the
welkin ring. The Brownie bugles struck up one of their
favorite national airs, "The Bonnie White Flag," which
begins,</p>

<p>The noble character of the Brownies was well shown
by the absence of jealousy on this occasion. Although
the navy had run from the Ram, the sailors cheered the
good trooper who had conquered. However, the Ensign
took no time to indulge in hurrahs and congratulations.
He pushed to the shore, exchanged his injured pony for
a fresh nag, and rode off to join MacWhirlie.</p>

<p>The Stygians at first could not credit the destruction
of their naval machine, least of all that it had been
wrought by a dragoon! Few of them had seen the combat.
They had left the Ram, as they supposed, to
follow and destroy the Ken, and had themselves pursued
the fleeing Natties at full speed. Many of them
had just seen the vessel as she went down. For the rest
the vacant water was the proof. The Ram was gone!
Their hopes had now also gone. With one half of the
fleet on the other side of the channel, they deemed discretion
the better part of valor, and slowly fell back
toward their harbor again.</p>

<p>Rodney longed to follow them, but for several good
reasons kept on his course up the channel. He had lost
two of his best ships, with Pipe, Fluke, True, Blythe,
Help, and many other brave men. In the hurly-burly
no one had observed the escape of Help and his boat
crew; they, as well as the crews of the Praise and the
Hope, were thought to be lost. Moreover, he knew not
but another Ram might be sent against him. Finally
he feared that if he did stop to attack the Stygians in
the harbor, the other squadron would sail around the
island, and he would thus be caught between the two
divisions. Much to his regret, therefore, he gave up the
plan to join with the army in attacking Big Cave camp,
and sailed up the channel to meet and engage the second
Pixie squadron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime MacWhirlie had fallen with his usual
vigor upon the enemy's camp. The pickets had been
driven in, and the outer line of works captured. The portable
davids of the cavalry carried upon the backs of their
bee ponies, a sort of flying artillery, were turned upon
the tents and inner works, and the shot played merrily.</p>

<p>But as fortune would have it, Bruce failed to get up
at the appointed time, and could not support his lieutenant
by attacking on the other side of the camp. During
the delay thus caused the incidents above related occurred;
the Pixies rallied, and reinforced by Stygians
from the returned ships, drove MacWhirlie back to the
outer line of entrenchment. Here he put up breastworks,
placed sentinels and picket lines, sent out scouts,
and waited for his captain.</p>

<p>Bruce soon appeared and the line was completed
around the Pixie camp, stretching in a half circle from
shore to shore. The great drawback was the absence of
the fleet. The Brownie commanders were concerned
about the safety of their position. Could they hold it
until Governor Wille came to their help? Or, would
anything interfere to hinder him from keeping his promise?
If he failed again, what should they do?</p>

<p>"However," said Bruce, "it is well not to cross a
river until we come to it. Ensign Lawe, take a troop
and ride over to the mansion. Get news of the Governor's
purpose. Remind him of his promise. If there
is any danger of another delay, come back post haste
with the news. And now, my men, let us to breakfast,
take a little rest and get ready for hard service. There's
plenty of it before us."</p>

<p>Soon after the bugle had sounded the sick call, one of
the sentinels on the picket line saw some one rapidly
approaching from the direction of the Pixie camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?" he cried.</p>

<p>"A friend without the countersign."</p>

<p>"Advance, friend without the countersign."</p>

</div>

<p>As the stranger drew near he showed the form and
features of a Brownie soldier. They were indeed marred
and wasted, and the uniform was tattered and soiled;
but a Brownie soldier the fugitive certainly was. When
he had come near enough the sentinel halted him and
called:</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard!
Post four!" When the Corporal
arrived the stranger was
ordered to advance to the post.</p>

<p>"Who are you and whence
do you come?" asked the Corporal.</p>

<p>"What! friend Steadypace," was
the reply, "don't you know me?
Well, well! A Pixie prison must
have made sad changes in me if you
can't recognize your old comrade
Dodge."</p>

<p>"Dodge? Dodge! Can it be?
Yes; so it is! Dear old fellow!"
Corporal Steadypace embraced his
friend, hurried him to the guard
tent, had him fed and tidied up,
meanwhile relating the particulars
of Sergeant Clearview's story, and what the Brownies
knew of his own capture. Thence Dodge was taken to
headquarters, where he was heartily greeted by the
Captain, and bidden tell the story of his adventures and
escape.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said Dodge, "when our boat was captured,
as Sergeant Clearview has told you, I was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to be the only survivor of the scouting party. The
Pixies made a great hurrah over me as they led me
through their fort, and I was pelted, hooted and cursed
by all the youngsters along the way. Spite the Spy
tried hard to pump out of me some information about
our plans, but failed."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my daisy," he said at last, "we'll try you
another time. Guards, take the Brownie off to the
Labyrinth."</p>

<p>"At this order I was led away to the shore, ferried
across the lake to Orchard Camp, and put in a prison
located on the lake side within the Pixie picket lines.
It is a curious structure, and looks as though several
architects had wrought upon the design. One of the
sides, built by Engineer Epeïra, is a delicately woven
orbweb. The other side, together with the gables, battlements
and roof have been built by Engineer Theridion.
The upper part of the prison is a maze of crossed lines,
in the midst of which is a dome after the style of Engineer
Linyphia. Above the dome is a dry leaf rolled up
into a hollow cylinder.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a> I was placed within this leaf,
which served as a dungeon or cell, and just beneath me
in the little silken dome the keeper of the prison had
her station. Her name, as I soon learned, is Labryinthea,
a suitable one certainly for the keeper of such an
establishment. Occasionally, two or three Pixies would
hang around the premises, joining in the watch or
exchanging gossip and flirtations with Madam Keeper.
A few survivors of a brood of younglings sported in the
maze, and when a small insect struck and was entangled
upon the threads, they would creep through the crosslines,
seize the unfortunate prey and feed upon it."</p>

<p>"But Dodge, pray tell us how you saw all this from
your inner prison?" asked the Captain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 96.&mdash;&quot;Above the Dome is a Dry Leaf Rolled Up.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Certainly. I didn't see anything for some time, my
leaf cell was so dark; but looking carefully around, I
found one spot where the roof was nearly worn through.
By some strange good fortune, when the Pixies searched
me before bringing me to the prison, they overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
my clasp knife which I had thrust into the band of my
Scotch bonnet. I was thus able to work out a space
large enough to let my head through. I cut out three
sides neatly, and made a sort of trap door that hinged
upon the uncut end. I was engaged on this for some
time, as I had to work secretly, catch all the chippings
in my hat, and then conceal them in my pockets. Had
they dropped upon the domed roof below they would
have awakened suspicion. By following the lines of the
leaf veins I made a cut so clean and close that my door
was quite concealed from ordinary notice. I now had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
many opportunities to peep out of my trap and see what
was going on around me. I thought I knew something
of Pixie tricks and ways before, but dear me! I learned
more from that hole in the roof than I ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>"There were several Pixies domiciled on the branches
of a tree that overhung the Labyrinth, whose manners
especially interested me. They are practicing a new
mode of harassing Brownies, a sort of patent spring
net."</p>

<p>The Brownie officers quickened attention at this
statement, for they are not only blessed with healthy
curiosity, but naturally are always vigilant to meet their
enemies' plots. Amidst a running fire of questions
Corporal Dodge told the following story: One day while
looking out of my door, I heard beneath me the voice
of Spite the Spy. From the prison talk I had already
picked up the news that Fort Spinder was abandoned,
and the Pixies transferred to Orchard camp, and was
not surprised at the chief's presence.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Spite in his rough way, "Where's old
Hyp this morning?"</p>

<p>Labyrinthea ran down her trap line, pushed her head
between the bars of a window and called out, "Who's
there?"</p>

<p>"Only myself, sweetheart!" answered one of her
lovers; and thereupon he sprang out of an adjoining
window and clambered up the ladder-like lines toward
the keeper.<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> But madam was in no humor for such
trifling, so she lashed the gallant heartily with a whip
of silken cords that she carried at her girdle along with
the prison key. The amorous Pixie retreated, more
rapidly than he had advanced, amidst the jeers and
laughter of the crowd beneath. The keeper again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
looked out and seeing who was there, asked what was
wanted.</p>

<p>"The Captain wants to see old Hyp," one of his aides
replied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_097.jpg" width="400" height="440"
alt="Fig. 97.&mdash;Madam Labyrinthea Lashes an Impudent Lover."

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 97.&mdash;Madam Labyrinthea Lashes an Impudent Lover.</span>
</div>

<p>"You'd better put a bridle on your tongue, young
sir," was the response. "Isn't it just as easy to call
folks by their proper names? 'Hyptiotes' isn't much
more to say than 'old Hyp;' and besides shows decent
respect to a better man than yourself."</p>

<p>Another burst of laughter greeted the discomfiture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the Pixie aide; after which Spite said: "We have
called to see this patent spring net that Hyptiotes has
invented. Where shall we find the fellow's laboratory?
It is close by here we are told."</p>

<p>The party was directed to the adjoining tree, a low
growth of pine, where they found the inventor awaiting
them. He was already stationed upon his net, which
he called from its shape the "Triangle," a name, by the
way, that has been transferred to himself. It is in fact
a triangular snare composed of four threads gradually
widening at one end and at the other converging upon a
single thread. The four threads are regularly crossed
in the manner of the common orbweb, and indeed the
whole snare resembles a section of four radii cut out of
a round snare. The line upon which the threads converge
is fastened to some fixed object and on this, back
downward, Hyptiotes was placed.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a></p>

<p>When Spite's party arrived he left his position to
greet them, and at once began to explain the spring net.
His son was stationed on the trap line, and as he got
into position I could see the whole snare rapidly tightening
up until every cord was taut. "Now," said Hyptiotes,
"observe that the operator holds that part of the
trap line next the net within his hands. The part next
the branch he holds with one foot. These two parts are
drawn tight. Now see! between the lad's two feet
there is a third portion of the line which is slack, and
coiled up in a loose ball."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Spite gruffly, "we all see that; but
how does the machine work? That's what we want to
know."</p>

<p>"Patience, Captain! I'm coming to that. Watch
please! I will let this bit of leaf represent the insect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
or a Brownie if you prefer. I shall throw it quickly
against the net and do you note what follows."</p>

<p>As the scrap struck the cross lines, instantly the whole
structure flew forward with a slight snap, then as suddenly
was drawn taut, and again snapped loose. This
was repeated several times. The leaf was caught by
the sudden relaxing and shooting forward of the cross
lines which by this motion were thrown around the leaf;
the latter, after several springs of the net, was completely
entangled and hung vibrating within the snare.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_098.jpg" width="400" height="315"
alt="Fig. 98.&mdash;The Snare of Hyptiotes."
title="Fig. 98.&mdash;The Snare of Hyptiotes." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 98.&mdash;The Snare of Hyptiotes.</span>
</div>

<p>"There," cried Hyptiotes, "you see how well it works!
Let me show you the principle. You have seen the coil
of slack line between the two feet. Fix your eye now
upon the foremost one. I will touch the net. See!
instantly this claw releases its hold upon the line, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the whole net shoots forward as far as the coil will
allow it. Follow closely, still, and you will see that the
claws rapidly pull in and tighten up the trap line while
the coil of slack line meanwhile again rolls up. That's
the whole secret of my spring net." So saying, Hyptiotes
put his front paws over his head, and stroked it
forward with a self-satisfied air as though he, at least,
had no doubt of the high merit of his trap.</p>

<p>Spite examined the structure carefully, made several
more trials of its working, and then expressed his hearty
approval. "Very good, indeed. I think it will be a
valuable addition to our armory. Now, if we only had
a few Brownies at hand for you to try it on, your
demonstration would be quite perfect. By the way&mdash;"
He clapped his hands together and laughed. "A capital
idea that!"</p>

<p>He turned to his staff of Pixie officers, and made
some remark which I could not hear. But they cast
glances upward toward my prison, and the thought
flashed upon me that Spite's sudden idea referred to me.
Could it be possible? Did they mean to test their new
machine on me? Two officers left the group and ran
toward the main gate of the Labyrinth. I closed my
trap door and with as composed frame as I could command,
awaited the issue. Soon Madam Labyrinthea
and the two Pixies were heard climbing up the ladder.
They entered the dome; they ascended to my cell.
"Come," they said without further ceremony, "follow
us. Our Captain has sent for you."</p>

<p>I was led to Hyptiotes' grounds; the Pixies formed a
wide circle around me and the inventor was ordered to
go ahead. Of course my captors supposed me to be ignorant
of their plans, and doubtless thought to take me by
surprise. But I was on my guard, although I hid my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
knowledge under an indifferent mien. I secretly slipped
my knife into my hand and waited.</p>

<p>"Go over to the opposite side of the circle!" ordered
Spite. I started in a quiet walk.</p>

<p>"Run!" shouted Spite fiercely.</p>

<p>"Run, run!" echoed the whole crowd in chorus, no
doubt thinking to startle and confuse me by their sudden
clamor.</p>

<p>I quickened my gait to a brisk trot, but kept my eyes
aslant toward the point where I saw young Hyptiotes
waiting to cast the net. In a moment the snare left
his hands and flew toward me. I dodged low to the
ground and made a quick leap toward the narrow end
of the snare, hoping thus to escape the worse entanglement
of the wide end. I was only partly successful.
In spite of my efforts I was caught in the narrow point
of the net and thrown by a sudden jerk to the earth.</p>

<p>The Pixies set up a roar of joy, which was lucky for
me, because under cover of their excitement I could
use my knife unobserved. In a trice I had freed my
limbs and risen upon my knees; and under pretence of
struggling and swinging my arms, severed the trap line
beyond the point of the snare with a swift stroke. I was
free, and getting to my feet began quietly to brush the
shreds of cobwebs from face and clothes.</p>

<p>The Pixie glee suddenly ceased. I heard the harsh
voice of old Hyptiotes roundly berating his son whom
he blamed, or chose to appear to blame, for the failure
of his invention. I knew better, but kept my secret.
However, I glanced toward young Hyptiotes who never
moved a muscle during all the cursing and clamor that
assailed him.<a name="FNanchor_AT_46" id="FNanchor_AT_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_46" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a> Meanwhile I slipped my knife beneath
my belt and quietly awaited the will of my captors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>"Take him back to prison," growled Spite; "We'll
try him again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," said old Hyptiotes, "and I'll then spring
the net myself, and answer with my head that the miserable
Brownie don't dodge out a second time."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 99.&mdash;&quot;Young Hyptiotes Never Moved a Muscle.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>I was led back to my cell, and my thoughts were not
very agreeable, you may be sure. But I resolved to at
least try to escape before the morrow. I knew my doom
was sealed if I remained, and could be no worse were I
caught trying to flee. I had already planned a way of
escape, and made some preparations for it. I waited
until nightfall, quietly opened my trap door, crept over
the roof, and softly stepped upon the ladder-like lines of
the maze which surrounds the
prison. Just at that moment I
heard a loud sound within the cell.
As ill fate would have it, my
keeper had taken a notion to visit
me! Perhaps she was anxious
about the morrow; maybe she
only wished to enjoy a sight of my
misery in view of my gloomy prospects.
At all events, she had
never before visited me at that hour, and now had
happened upon me at the worst possible time. I cast
an anxious glance backward, and, O wretched blunder!
saw that I had forgotten to close the trap door behind
me. My way of exit would of course be seen at once
and the cry be raised.</p>

<p>What should I do? Think quickly, Dodge! and
think well, for your life hangs upon this moment's
decision. I heard the sharp cry of Madam Labyrinthea.
I could feel the swing of her body as she threw
herself upon the ladder that led up to the trap door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">my former night adventures, cut
open one of these, and made a burrow within. I hardly
knew at the time why I did this, but it was one of my
old dodges (which I had taught Sergeant Clearview, by
the way), when out on a scout to take refuge in one of
these vacant Pixie baby houses. They are snug and
comfortable places, too. Now I
saw what to do! I swung myself,
by a line across the intervening
space, pushed open the little slit
in the side of the cocoon, crawled
within, curled myself up, drew
down the flap closely, and waited.<a name="FNanchor_AU_47" id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a>
My heart beat a tattoo. I could
see nothing, but heard the feet of
Labyrinthea rattling over the
roof; felt the tremor of the lines
as she sprang from them, after a
pause, during which I guessed
that she was looking around for
me. I heard her loud alarm to
the guards; felt the shaking of
the Labyrinth foundations as the
Pixies ran to and fro; more than
once felt the pressure of feet
clambering over the cocoons in
the hurried rush across the maze.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 177px;">
<img src="images/fig_101.jpg" width="177" height="400"

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 101.&mdash;Labyrinthea&#39;s Cocoon String.</span>
</div>

<p>There was great commotion at the gate of the jail;
then the din lessened, grew faint, rolled away and died
out in the distance. No one had thought of my retreat
as a possible hiding place. For the present at least, I
was safe, though much cramped in my close quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
I opened the slit for a breath of fresh air, and ventured
to look out. All was still. Shall I slip out now or not?
I queried. No! The whole Pixie host is afoot, beating
the bushes in every quarter. I cannot run such a gauntlet
of eager searchers without detection. I will wait
until the pursuers are tired out and have returned.
They will give me up, will relax guard around the
prison, and beyond it the coast will be clear.</p>

<p>So I did. I heard the returning guards; heard Labyrinthea
puffing and storming up the stairway to her
dome, and as I kept the slit in the cocoon a little ajar
could even make out her angry oaths. Her disappointment
at my escape evidently softened her toward her
gallants, for I heard her exchanging views with the one
whom she had lashed away from her in the morning,
over the mysterious disappearance of her prisoner. How
could he have got off unnoticed? It was plain from the
talk that Spite suspected the keeper herself of some
connivance at my escape; but I wasn't much concerned
about that.</p>

<p>As the day dawned everything was quiet. The keeper
and guards were asleep. Now is my time, I thought.
So I left my cramped but cosy silken retreat, slid down
the ropes to the ground, and glided away into the grass.
I got safely through the Pixie lines, made myself known
to our own pickets, and here I am, thankful and happy
as ever Brownie was or will be!</p>

<p>Dodge's story was eagerly listened to, and he was
heartily congratulated upon his rare good fortune. Bruce
and his officers questioned him about all that he had
seen within the enemy's lines, and drew from him much
valuable information. Then as a reward for his skill and
pluck, and as a salve for his sufferings, he was promoted
to be a sergeant and went away jubilant to his quarters.</p>

<p>The Ken, it will be remembered, made for Ellen's
Isle, when pursued by the Pixie Rain. Lieutenant
Swift never checked her speed until he had run his
ship under the shelter of the northern shore. Thence
he rejoined the fleet, after the Ram had gone down, and
sailed on with Rodney up the channel.</p>

<p>Coxswain Help steered for the island. The Stygians
lay between him and his own fleet, and should he
make for Orchard shore he would risk capture. Ellen's
Isle was nearest; his boat was overloaded; the Ken
seemed to be already there awaiting them under the
northern bank.</p>

<p>"Give way heartily, lads," he said, "we shall soon
be on board the Ken."</p>

<p>The sailors pulled with a will, and although loaded
down almost to the gunwale, the boat made fair speed.
The sinking of the Ram, which they saw quite plainly,
put fresh vigor into their arms. They could hardly
hold in their cheers; but Help ordered silence, as he
had no wish to call the Pixies' attention to them. The
island was reached, but a sore disappointment awaited
them, for the Ken had gone on, and the Nattie ships
were far up the channel. Clearview climbed atop of a
bush and looked across the island to the south channel.</p>

<p>"There is the Pixie squadron crowding on all sail
toward the inlet," he said. "The Stygians are not yet
in sight of our fleet, but it cannot be long before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
meet. Look yonder to the north! The other half of
the Pixie fleet has sailed out of the harbor, and is
running up the channel." Now the officers consulted
as to what should be done.</p>

<p>"My duty is on the water," said Help, "I yield the
chief command to our superior officer, Adjutant Blythe.
Captain Clearview will take command of the boat. I
shall lend a hand wherever I can."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Blythe; "but let us settle what is
to be done first. We can fix the matter of rank afterward."</p>

<p>"Well said, Adjutant," remarked True. "In our condition
the readiest helper has the highest rank. Let
him lead us, who knows how to get us out of trouble.
Can't we cross the south channel? That's our own side,
you know."</p>

<p>"Not in one trip of our boat," said Clearview. "It
was shipping water freely before we landed. The distance
to the south shore is much greater than that which
we have come. We might divide and make two trips,
but that doubles the risk, and gives less chance to the
party left behind should the Pixies land here. Suppose
we wait until the fleets meet, and act as may then seem
best. See! even while we speak, one of the Pixie ships
is landing at the head of the island."</p>

<p>"Can you make her out, Captain?" asked Help.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's the Doubt, Master Shallow's craft. I
would know the cut of her jib among a thousand."</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" asked Blythe. "Are they
sending boats ashore?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have anchored off the Big Rocks; and
one, two, three boats are pulling into the cove above."</p>

<p>"Three, did you say?" returned Blythe. "Then let us
attack them, and we shall have enough boats wherewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to leave the island. I feel that I could almost clean
out a boat load myself."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 102.&mdash;&quot;Abandoned Snares.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"No, no, Adjutant!" answered True; "nobody
doubts either your ability or appetite for fighting Pixies.
But we can't afford to take such a risk. My advice is
that we run our boat under these clumps of iris, and
bivouac for a while beneath the thick foliage that crowns
yonder bank. We shall be out of sight, shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
time to rest the men, and can then get off safely. We
have everything to gain by waiting."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/fig_103.jpg" width="298" height="300"
alt="Fig. 103.&mdash;&quot;Vacant Lodges.&quot;"
title="Fig. 103.&mdash;&quot;Vacant Lodges.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 103.&mdash;&quot;Vacant Lodges.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>True's advice was taken. The boat was hidden,
a snug bivouac was made near a clump of hazel bushes
upon the high land beyond the shore, and the crew threw
themselves upon the grass to rest. Scouts were sent out
to beat around the neighboring foliage in search of lurking
Pixies. There were many signs that they had lately
been upon the spot, such as abandoned snares and vacant
lodges, and deserted nurseries woven into balls from
the seeded and feathery
tops of grasses.
Apparently, all who
could march or sail
or move through the
air had gone off to
join the Pixie forces
on land or water.
Only a colony of
youngling Orbweavers
remained snugly
tented around a
Jack-in-the-Pulpit.
Most of them were
balled in a round mass under one of the leaves, packed together,
with legs and arms intertwined, and sound asleep.</p>

<p>One of the Scouts was keen to mount the plants,
cut the tent cords and disperse the brood of younglings.
But Blythe forbade, "for," said he, "they'll keep
under cover while we are on the island, and it's always
wise to let well enough alone. They can do us no
harm, so we'll not harm them."</p>

<p>Now, Captain Clearview and Sergeant True climbed
into a tree to note how the two fleets came on. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
a heavy heart they saw their squadron, after a brief
struggle, sail away toward the inlet. The Doubt rejoined
her companions,
but one
of her boats remained
upon the
island. What
could that portend?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/fig_104.jpg" width="265" height="500"
alt="Fig. 104.&mdash;&quot;Deserted Nurseries Woven into Balls.&quot;"
title="Fig. 104.&mdash;&quot;Deserted Nurseries Woven into Balls.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 104.&mdash;&quot;Deserted Nurseries Woven into Balls.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Clearview and
True told what
they had seen,
and urged all to
guard against
surprise. Their
enemies were on
the island. How many
there were, or for what
purpose they stayed, or
where they might be,
none knew. They were
probably still in the eastern end, and
would not at once annoy the Brownies,
whose presence they could not suspect.
Sentinels were posted toward the land
side, and one lookout upon the shore.</p>

<p>So the morning passed, and the afternoon
had nearly worn away. The fleets
had not changed their positions. The
Stygians still guarded the inlet, but the
heavy davids mounted at the mouth
thereof held them in check. Two or
three Pixie vessels were slowly sailing down the north
channel coasting along the island. There had been no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
sign of the Doubt's mysterious boat's crew. All was
quiet. No chance yet to escape.</p>

<p>A squad under Help's command was sent out to forage.
They had not been gone long when the little camp
was aroused by an alarm from one of the sentinels. The
Brownies sprang to arms, thinking that the Doubt's boat
crew had attacked them. There was a sound as of feet
trampling among ferns and grasses. Some one was approaching
rapidly,&mdash;several persons evidently; and they
were charging at full run upon the picket line.</p>

<p>"Stand!" cried the guard. "Who goes there?"</p>

<p>There was no reply. Then one of the sailors of
Help's squad, and a second, and a third leaped from the
underbrush, sprang by the sentinel regardless of his
challenge, and ran into the midst of the camp. They
were breathless, pale, trembling, terrified.</p>

<p>"Well," cried Blythe, "this is something new, truly!
Full sized Brownies, and Natties at that, running like a
frightened rabbit from a Pixie! Why, comrades, what
has possessed you? Speak, can't you?" They could
not speak. The poor fellows were so overcome that they
had to sit down. Water was given them, and they revived.</p>

<p>"Come, now," said True firmly, "this has gone far
enough. What is the cause of this?"</p>

<p>One of the three could just utter the single word&mdash;"Pipe!"
The very name set the sailors shivering again
with terror.</p>

<p>"This is most unaccountable!" exclaimed Blythe.
"What do you mean, fellow? What about Pipe? Do
you mean our poor boatswain who was lost this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" gasped the sailor. "We&mdash;have&mdash;seen&mdash;him!
Oh, oh!" He uttered a cry as he spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
jumped to his feet, threw up his arms, pointed toward
the picket line and fell flat upon the grass.</p>

<p>All eyes turned in the direction of the poor fellow's
hand. There stood Pipe the Boatswain! A chorus
of mingled groans, shrieks and cries arose from the
company. The sailors scattered into the ferns and
bushes. The officers stood their ground, but there was
not one among them who would not have run had he
dared.</p>

<p>The figure slowly advanced. The eyes were sunken,
the face pale, the hair hung damp and matted around
the face and brow. The clothes were ragged and clung
closely to the body. The eyes had, or seemed to have,
an unnatural brightness. They were fixed steadily
upon the officers. Step by step, nearer and nearer the
figure came. But it spoke no word. There could be
no mistake about it. It was Pipe the drowned boatswain!</p>

<p>Now Sergeant True, like most sensible persons, knew
that if there were such things as ghosts they must be
harmless creatures. He had often said that; and declared
that he would like to meet a ghost. But if
the truth were known, he would rather have been excused
just then. However, he spoke at last.</p>

<p>"Speak! whatever you be! Spirit, ghost, or living
flesh,&mdash;tell us what you are, and why you are come
here!"</p>

<p>The figure stopped. A strange, familiar light played
upon the pale face, and glimmered around the corner
of the eyes. Then into the death-like silence the image
spoke with a husky voice:</p>

<p>"Well, shipmates, this is a rather tough greeting on
one's return from a long voyage! What's i' the wind,
that you all run from your old comrade, and stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
staring at me as though I were a ghost? Hey, my
boy, don't you know Sophie's daddy?"</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 105.&mdash;&quot;A Colony of Youngling Orbweavers as Snugly Tented Under a Jack-in-the-Pulpit.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Pipe, Pipe! it is Pipe himself!" exclaimed True,
and he rushed forward and took the dear old sailor in
his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, there," said the boatswain, "that'll do for
the present. Cast off grapnels, please, and save your
hugging for some one who likes it better. Hello, you
lubbers!"&mdash;addressing the sailors,&mdash;"get up, here!
I'm ashamed of the cloth, I am. Yes, it's Pipe&mdash;who
else? Want proof of it, do you?" The sailors were
sitting upon the ground staring, dumb and incredulous,
upon their old officer. "Well, here goes then.
You know the sound of pipe to quarters, I'll be bound."
So saying he put his whistle to his lips, and sounded
the old familiar note.</p>

<p>It was enough. The frightened foragers rose and
shook hands with Pipe. The scattered runaways came
back. An eager crowd surrounded the boatswain to hear
him explain this marvelous resurrection from the deep.</p>

<p>"Well, it's easily enough explained. Come to think
of it now, I don't wonder that you took me for a ghost.
In sooth, it is not often that a Brownie stays under
water for a whole day, and comes up again, unless, may
be, as a ghost."</p>

<p>"What! Under water a whole day?" cried Help.
"You don't mean that seriously, do you?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, shipmate, that I do. It has not been
half an hour since I left the depths of the lake there.
I went down with the rest under the keel of that infernal
old pot that the Pixies set afloat. I supposed
my time had come at last. But no one seems to be
willing to die even when his time has come; so you
see, I struck out pretty lively, so as to get clear of the
wreck and the drowning crews as I came up, and then
allowed myself to rise. First thing I knew I was diving
straight through the door of a water pixie's nest! You
know there are some of those creatures who make a
kind of hollow globe or diving bell under the water."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said True eagerly, "the Argyroneta pixies."</p>

<p>"Aye, those are the fellows. Well, they stay and
balance their nest with cables, which they fasten to
stems of water plants; then they mount to the surface,
catch a bubble of air in the little hairs of their legs
and hands, sink with it and shoot it up into the nest.
When it is filled they have a water-tight house filled
with air, down in the very midst of the lake. It is a
cunning thing even if it is made by a Pixie.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 106.&mdash;Pipe&#39;s Escape from the Water Pixie&#39;s Den.</span>
</div>

<p>"Well there
I was, snug and
comfortable
enough. The housekeeper
didn't happen
to be at home, and I
had full possession of
the premises. I
couldn't make up my
mind what to do. Of course, I knew that I couldn't
stay there always; but I feared to crawl out and mount
to the surface. Either way my chance seemed pretty
slim for life. I concluded to wait a while anyhow, and
stretched myself upon a sort of web hammock that
hung from the sides. I looked every moment for the
landlady to report, and loosened my knife to welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
her home. However, she didn't come, and after a long
waiting I fell asleep. How long I slept I don't know.
I was aroused by a slight swaying of the diving bell
nest. The proprietor was coming in, sure as the world!
She was already half way through the port-hole. I
clutched my knife and got ready to cut away. But
a thought struck me. Think's I, can't I lay hold of
the old lady, and get her to tow me out of this, and
may be ashore? I put my knife between my teeth and
waited quietly until Mrs. Argyroneta had got fairly
into her cabin. Then I leaped from my hammock,
grabbed her by a hind leg, and yelled at the top of my
lungs. Whew! you ought to have seen that Pixie get.
She turned and made through the port, mounted to the
surface, and flew across it like the flying Dutchman.
I found it a little hard to hold on to her leg. But the
creature had cast out of her spinnerets a good stout cable
as she turned to leave her nest, which I seized with both
hands.<a name="FNanchor_AV_48" id="FNanchor_AV_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>"I should hate to say how many knots an hour we
rated. The Pixie went so fast that my head was kept
above water by the swiftness of the motion. She made
straight for the island, and upon my word, I believe she
would have towed me clear ashore if it hadn't been for
an accident. In doubling the edge of a cluster of water
lilies my tug struck a snag and capsized. The rope slackened
and I had to swim for it. Mrs. Argyroneta dived.
Not relishing a second journey to the bottom of the lake, I
cut the cable with my knife and clambered on top of a lily
leaf. After some trouble I managed to cut the leaf loose,
and as the wind and current set in toward the island,
I drifted ashore just below here. I had scarcely landed
when I met these hearties here, who broke off into the
woods at a livelier rate than even my Pixie tug had made.
That is the whole of my yarn. And now if you please,
give me something to eat for I'm mortal hungry."</p>

<p>"What became of your Pixie?" asked Blythe.</p>

<p>"Never saw her after she dived," returned Pipe. "I
reckon she's going yet, for a worse scared creature, barring
these three Jacks of ours, of course, I never saw.
But, come comrades, here I have been spinning my yarn
about my own miserable carcass, and all the time have
heard nothing of the fleet. To tell the truth, I've been
afraid to ask. But let me know the worst, all of it, while
the cooks are getting supper ready."</p>

<p>The story was soon told. The good sailor was glad to
find affairs had gone no worse. His joy over the ignoble
end of the Pixie monitor was particularly keen.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said, "just what I thought. A lubberly
old pot! And any seaman that would sail in such
an affair deserves no better fate than to be sent to the
bottom by a dragoon's cutlass."</p>

<p class="chapname">THE WISDOM OF THE PIXIES.</p>


<p>In the meantime how fared it with Faith and Sophia?
The hours of captivity dragged wearily along. The
nagging and petty annoyance of their keeper were hard
to bear, but their chief dread was the coming of Spite
and Hide. They knew nothing of passing events, for
not a creature had been seen or heard since Spite and
Raft left, except Tigrina. In the depths of that Pixie
cave they were shut off from the upper world, and their
grim and vigilant guardian kept them strictly to their
rooms.</p>

<p>They had no heart at first to note the furnishings of
their prison. But as time passed their spirits somewhat
rallied. They began to observe the things around them,
which were wrought with exquisite taste and skill.
Tapestry, carpets, sofas, cushions, stools, couches all were
woven of silk. There were pictures and statuary, books
and portfolios bound elegantly in yellow, purple and
white silk, and illuminated with gold, bronze and divers
colors.<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a> The Nurses wandered from one to another of
these objects, which compelled their admiration and interest.
The works of art were exquisitely done.</p>

<p>Many of the books, the maidens noticed, treated of
natural objects, laws, forces, and phenomena. The
wonders of air, earth, and sea were told and illustrated
in many volumes. Faith and Sophia were much interested
in these. Their fondness for Nature was great, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the books and prints which lay around them in such
wealth well nigh beguiled their thoughts from their
griefs.</p>

<p>"Look at this, Sophie," cried Faith, who had just
happened upon a rare volume rich in the arts of type,
graver and brush. It lay by itself on a circular stand,
as one sometimes sees a costly family Bible in American
homes. It was plainly one of the treasures of Arachne
Hall. Sophia came to her friend's side and bent over
the title page which read thus:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The Wisdom of the Pixies.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL OF THE LAWS OF PLUTO,
AND THE WISE SAYINGS OF THE SAGES OF PIXIELAND.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anno Mundi;<span style="letter-spacing: .25em">....</span><span class="allcaps"><span class="ovl">M</span>
<span class="ovl" style="padding-left: .50em;">M</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: .25em">....,....</span><span class="allcaps">MDCCC.</span></span>"</p>

<p>"The Wisdom of the Pixies!" exclaimed Sophia.
"That must be a curious book indeed. I never knew
before that our wicked enemies professed to have a sacred
book, or held to any religious notions at all. I am
anxious to know what these laws of Pluto may be.
Turn over the page, Faith."</p>

<p>"I am trying to make out this date," answered Faith.
"The numerals have been erased; they appear to have
been written several times, amended again and again,
and finally left in this uncertain condition."</p>

<p>"That is just it, Faith. Observe that for the common
date, 'Anno Domini&mdash;year of our Lord,' has been
placed 'Anno Mundi&mdash;year of the World.' It is hard
for a Pixie to acknowledge in any way the Blessed
Author of Salvation to Men. Let me see!&mdash;M stands
for one thousand; M, M for two thousand; the bar over
the top means a thousand also. <span class="ovl">M</span> is one thousand
thousand, <span class="ovl">M</span>, <span class="ovl">M</span> two thousand thousand, and just there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
is a gap. The other legible figures count up eighteen
hundred. That is all I can make out; but I suppose
the Pixies mean to say that the world is a good many
thousand times two hundred thousand years old! Do
you believe it?"</p>

<p>"That's a ripe old age, Sophie," said Faith, "and I
neither believe nor disbelieve. How can one tell? Our
fathers only say that 'in the beginning,' whenever that
was, the world was made. But the further back one
can trace the being of the earth by established facts,
just so much further can we 'walk by sight' into the
Eternity whose sovereign Lord we receive by faith."</p>

<p>"True enough," replied Sophia, "the question interests
me as a matter of fact simply. As a matter of
religion, I suppose it has little value. At least, I have
so heard the good minister Dr. Comingo say in conversation
with Governor Wille. But turn the page, please!"</p>

<p>Faith turned the leaves of the book, reading aloud
the titles of the chapters. Now and then she stopped,
read a sentence or two, commented upon the sentiment,
and contrasted it with the good, pure, unselfish laws of
Brownieland. Our story need not be burdened with
much of what Faith and Sophia saw in the "Wisdom of
the Pixies," but some of our older readers will be curious
to have a few extracts. Here they are, with the headings
or titles of the chapters given, for the most part:</p>

<p>Chapter I. On the First and Great Law&mdash;Take Care
of Number One.... Chapter II. On the Chief End
of Life&mdash;Eat, Drink and be Merry, for To-morrow You
Die.... Chapter IX. The End Justifies the Means.... Chapter
X. On Attaining One's End: By Fair
Means if You Can, by Foul Means if You Must.... Chapter
XV. Showing That an Individual Cannot
Wrong a Corporation&mdash;On the Right of Corporations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Plunder the People.... Chapter XVI. Showing That
it Cannot be Wrong to Rob a Government.... Chapter
XVII. Showing That Since the World Loves to be
"Humbugged," it is Quite Lawful to Gratify it, for
One's Own Advantage.... Chapter XXXV. Is Man
an Automaton?</p>

<p>"Why, what a strange notion!" cried Sophie.
"What sage starts that question?"</p>

<p>"It appears to be some Chinese sage whose sentiments
are quoted, if I may judge by the name&mdash;Hoox
Lee."</p>

<p>"And what has he to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, there is a good deal. Here's a section on the
'Evidence of Transmitted Peculiarities' that starts out
thus: Every one has noted the interest that the young
of the human species take in dolls, marionettes, and
exhibitions of such figures as the famous Punch and
Judy, and Mrs. Jarley's wax works. This is a universal
characteristic. Whence does it arise? Why should
this instinctive sympathy of children with Automata
and their clumsy tricks, be so deep-seated and wide-spread?
Evidently here is a fact which the wise and
candid philosopher should ponder. Here, it may be, is
a thread by which we may traverse the labyrinth of
man's mysterious nature. The deduction cannot well
be resisted, that this natural and inwrought sympathy
with the Automaton, in all its varying forms, is owing
to the kinship of man himself with the Simian."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will do!" exclaimed Sophia breaking short
the sentence. "That certainly is quite as funny as the
Punch and Judy which Governor Wille had shown at
his children's party, last Thanksgiving Day. But is
Mr. Hoox Lee in earnest do you think?"</p>

<p>"He seems to be," answered Faith, joining in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Sophia's quiet laughter. "But here is the next chapter."
Chapter XL. To be Found Out is the Essence
of Wrong.</p>

<p>"Turn on!"</p>

<p>Chapter XLIII. The Pleasure and Security of
Drinking Liquors in Moderation.... Chapter XLIX.
Wine and Beer Drinking the Sovereign Remedy for
Drunkenness.... Chapter L. On the Origin of the
Universe.</p>

<p>"Ah! What has the sage to say on that point?"
asked Sophia.</p>

<p>"Far too much to read now. This seems to be a
favorite theme with the sages; there are a great many
pages. Here is the opening section: 'According to the
sacred writings of the Pundits of India, a certain immense
spider was the origin, the first cause of all things.
This spider drawing the matter from its own bowels,
wove the web of this universe, and disposed it with
wonderful art. She, in the meantime sitting in the centre
of her work, feels and directs the motions of every
part, till at length, when she has pleased herself sufficiently
in ordering and contemplating this web, she
draws again into herself all the threads she had spun
out and, having absorbed them, the universal nature
of all creatures vanishes into nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Sophia, "how very like that is to
the 'nebular theory' that we heard the Professor discussing
one evening with Governor Wille on the great
porch. But pray, whence came the spider? Who made
her? I wonder the sages didn't think of that question?"</p>

<p>Faith resumed the reading: "The natives of Guinea
believe that the first man was created by a large black
spider which is so common in their country, and is called
in their jargon 'Ananse.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, that is too bad!" said Sophia once more interrupting
the reading. "I could believe that the
Pixies came that way, but to say that men were so
made! But that is the way with the sages of unbelief.
They had rather think the universe to have been spun
out of the spinnerets of a big black spider, than admit
that in the beginning the Holy God made all things."</p>

<p>Faith made no answer, but stood silently turning over
the leaves. The silence was broken by a sound that
startled the Nurses, and struck terror into their hearts.
We must go back to the Brownie's island camp in order
to explain this sudden interruption.</p>

<p class="chapname">BLYTHE'S FLUTE.</p>


<p>Despite their position the wrecked Brownies were in
good spirits. The restoration of Pipe had taken a load
off their hearts. The reaction was so great, after their
grief and the certainty of his loss, that low spirits vanished
from the camp. The boatswain's resurrection
seemed an omen of good fortune. The cheer that filled
all hearts bubbled over in song, laughter, merry tale
and joke. But as the Brownies feared to attract the
attention of the Doubt's crew who were yet on the island,
they kept the sound of their merrymaking within bounds
of their picket lines.</p>

<p>Blythe added much to the enjoyment of the occasion.
By some rare chance, as he was setting out for the fleet
in the morning, he had flung over his shoulder his flute
box, which he often carried in a little case something
after the manner of a field glass. It had clung to him
when the Ken's boat went down, and there was the flute,
ready to swell the joy of the bivouac. Blythe was quite
in the spirit to play, and all hearts were in tune to
listen.</p>

<p>Again and again the notes of the sweet instrument
murmured among the overhanging branches. Camp
tunes, battle tunes, love tunes, home tunes&mdash;the hearts
of the Brownies were stirred by turns with tender,
pathetic, sad or fond emotions as the well known strains
fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>"Come, lads," cried Pipe, "cannot we have a song?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye, a song, a song!" was called from all sides.</p>

<p>"What shall it be?" asked Blythe. "I will gladly
accompany Captain Clearview here, who is an excellent
singer. Captain, what say you? Shall we have 'Woodmen,
Boatmen, Sailors and Horsemen?' The lads like
that and can join in the chorus."</p>

<p>"Play away!" said Clearview, and at the proper note
he struck in and sang the following song, in the refrain
of which all the company joined:</p>

<p class="center">THE BROWNIES' NATIONAL SONG.</p>

<p>"Hist&mdash;st!"</p>

<p>The sharp prolonged sibilant that broke in upon their
applause and caused instant silence, was uttered by
Sergeant True. He advanced into the circle with his
hand raised warningly.</p>

<p>"Hist! Quiet all!&mdash;except you, Blythe. Keep on
with your music. Play some of your softest airs, and
play until I bid you stop. As for the rest of you, I
charge you, for your lives, not to speak or move until
you hear from me. No matter what you see&mdash;perfect
silence, remember!"</p>

<p>He stepped back again into the bushes and was hidden
from sight. What could the strange interruption mean?
The Brownies were all alive with keen curiosity. Was
the Sergeant in a merry humor, and planning some trick
upon the party? They suspected that. But it was not
much after True's habit to do such a thing. Besides,
his manner betokened unusual earnestness. Therefore,
all sat still, looking into the bushes whither True had
disappeared. The Adjutant promptly fell into his
friend's plan. He obeyed orders, played away and
waited.</p>

<p>"Hist! look up! But don't stop the music, and don't
stir!" said True in a low voice.</p>

<p>All eyes turned upward. A faint rustling among the
branches directed the party's gaze to the point of
interest. A quaint old hag of a Pixie was slowly crawling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
along the twig above Blythe's head. It was our acquaintance,
Dame Tigrina!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Boy&#39;s Illustration.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 108.&mdash;Blythe&#39;s Flute Charms Tigrina.</span>
</div>

<p>Blythe's heart fluttered a little, it must be confessed.
It really seemed that the grim creature was preparing
to pounce upon him. See! she is just above the musician's
head. She has fastened a cable to the branch
and is slowly lowering herself toward the ground.
There was a slight quaver in the notes of the flute that
could not be credited wholly to the performer's intention.
Yet, he behaved with wonderful coolness and courage.
The music went on; not a false note, not a pause, while
the Pixie was gradually lowering herself toward the
ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>When about one-third of the descent had been made,
Tigrina paused and sat quite still. She was listening to
the music, not foraging for victims! Blythe's flute had
charmed her forth from her cell. There she hung in
mid air indulging her fondness for sweet sounds. Who
would have thought it of the old hag? However, it
would perhaps be well to mention that it has frequently
been reported that some Pixies are strangely sensitive
to music.<a name="FNanchor_AX_50" id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a></p>

<p>True's conduct was now explained. He had caught
a glimpse of the Pixinee when she first left her hall, but
had not been able to mark the spot from which she
came. When the singing stopped and the applause
began, Tigrina retreated so rapidly and stealthily that
the Sergeant again failed to note the door of her cave,
but saw the general direction and neighborhood thereof.
He thought that if Blythe would repeat the music it
would charm the old creature forth once more, and so it
proved.</p>

<p>From his blind in the bushes he saw the cave door
slowly open, and marked the spot. He saw the Pixinee
peep here and there, then, satisfied that the coast was
clear, return to her place above the musician, where she
hung and listened as before.</p>

<p>True had gained his point. He did not indeed understand
how near he was to his heart's great desire. But
he had thought it probable that Faith and Sophia might
be hidden on the island in some of the Pixie dens, and
at once resolved to follow up this fortunate incident in
hope that it might give a clew to a more important discovery.
He quietly left his hiding place, planted himself
before the spot whence Tigrina had come, and drew his
battle axe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hist!" The sound directed the Brownies' attention
toward him. "Close in around me when I call.
Don't move before that. Now, Blythe,&mdash;stop!"</p>

<p>The music ceased. No one stirred for a moment or
two; then Tigrina, as though persuaded that the performance
had ended, scampered up the cable from which
she hung, and hurried off toward her cave.</p>

<p>"Close up!" ordered True.</p>

<p>The company rushed forward and surrounded the
Sergeant, who now stood with axe poised, face to face
with the Pixinee. Tigrina was in the act of springing
upon True. Her claws were outstretched, her eyes were
ablaze with excitement, and in the greatness of her
wrath her fangs clattered against each other.</p>

<p>As the Brownies closed the circle about her, she
started, and cast a quick, terrified glance around her.
Then her whole visage changed; the arms fell to her
side; her face dropped upon her chest; her limbs relaxed;
the eyes became glassy and fixed; she suddenly sank to
the ground and lay rigid and motionless.</p>

<p>True lowered his axe. An exclamation of surprise
broke from the group.</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" asked several at once.</p>

<p>Pipe stepped to Tigrina's side and cautiously turned
her body with his foot.</p>

<p>"'Pon my honor," he said, "I do believe the old witch
has burst a blood-vessel, or had an attack of apoplexy.
She's dead as a mackerel."</p>

<p>"It does seem so, indeed," remarked True, who had
also examined the body. "There is every sign of death,
beyond doubt. For my part I don't wonder, for I never
saw such a swift and terrible change in any living creature
as came over this one."</p>

<p>"Come," said Clearview, "let me try an experiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
I know something more of the tricks of these Pixies
than you. They can beat the 'possums at feigning
death. Now, I venture that Madame here is as alive
and awake as any of you. Stand back a little. We
shall see. Bring me a cord."</p>

<p>A stout cord was brought by one of the sailors. Clearview
approached cautiously, and looped the rope around
all the Pixinee's limbs except one arm. During all this
there was no sign of life.</p>

<p>"Hand me your axe, Sergeant." The weapon was
passed to him. "Observe now," continued Clearview,
"that I intend to strike just where that claw lies. If
the creature is dead it will not hurt her to have it
chopped off."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig_109.jpg" width="500" height="124"

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 109.&mdash;Attitudes of Spiders when Feigning Death.</span>
</div>

<p>He lifted the axe deliberately, and struck directly at
the unbound arm which was stretched out motionless
upon the grass. The blade sank into the ground! The
claw had been removed by a quick motion as the axe fell.</p>

<p>"Phew&mdash;&mdash;ew!" said Pipe, drawing a long breath.
"Talk about wonders of the stage! That acting beats
Charlotte Cushman all hollow."<a name="FNanchor_AY_51" id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a></p>

<p>A burst of merriment broke from the circle of astonished
and amused Brownies, in the midst of which
Tigrina slowly raised her body from the ground, and sat
up looking around upon her captors, quite crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at last, "now you have me, what'll
you do with me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>The Brownie officers held a brief, whispered consultation.
Then the boatswain addressed Tigrina.</p>

<p>"Old woman, we shall exchange few words with you.
You know well that your life in ordinary circumstances
wouldn't be worth a salt herring. But you've just one
chance for it. I have lost a daughter. She was carried
off with one of her companions by some of your people.
We have found no trace of the maidens yet. If you
can tell anything that shall lead to their discovery, your
life shall be spared. If not, you die instantly."</p>

<p>Tigrina sat with eyes fixed upon the ground. Her
face had a stubborn cast that showed indifference to life,
or determination to yield nothing for the sake of saving
it. She remained silent.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the boatswain, "have you nothing
to say? Do you know anything? Speak out. You
shall find us true to our word, as Brownies always are."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," cried Blythe impatiently, "if
you can put us on the track of our lost friends, do so!
You shall not only have your life, but whatever
besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hah! What interest have you in the silly things?"
asked Tigrina looking up quickly. Her whole manner
had changed at the first sound of his voice. Her eyes
dropped slowly from the Adjutant's face to the flute
which he still held in his hands, and there remained
fixed.</p>

<p>"I have a deep and tender interest in one of them,"
exclaimed Blythe. "And I pledge you my word, with
the boatswain, to stand between you and death if you
will tell us where we can find Faith and Sophia."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, so profound that one
might almost have heard his neighbor's heart beat as the
Brownies awaited the Pixinee's answer. The fate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
their beloved Nurses seemed to hang upon her lips.
Tigrina at last broke the silence:</p>

<p>"You will give me my life?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried a score of eager voices.</p>

<p>"And set me free?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" was the hearty chorus.</p>

<p>"And give me&mdash;that?" continued Tigrina, pointing
her hairy claw toward the flute in Blythe's hand.</p>

<p>"It is yours!" cried the Adjutant, flinging the instrument
into the Pixinee's lap.</p>

<p>Tigrina clutched it eagerly, turned it over and over,
as a child would a new toy, looked into it, touched the
keys, put it to her ears and listened, then laid it down
upon her lap and gazed at it with childish fondness.
All this time the Brownies looked on impatiently, but
not inclined to interfere.</p>

<p>"Hah!" exclaimed Tigrina, "and will it sing for me,
too? Pretty bird! Sing, sing!" she said as she fondled
the flute tenderly.</p>

<p>"Come, come, old lady," cried Pipe at last. "Be done
with this nonsense! Remember that neither life, freedom,
nor the flute are yours until you keep your part
of the bargain. So hurry up."</p>

<p>Tigrina looked up again with the old fierce, sullen
face. "Ugh! To be sure. Well, gentlemen, I have
sworn not to tell any one where the fairies are. But
that big officer yonder&mdash;," she cast a savage glance at
True, "knows where I live, I reckon. There's nothing
to hinder you from following up what you have already
found out yourselves, is there?"</p>

<p>A cry of joy arose from the party at these words. The
hint was taken at once. What news! Faith and
Sophia were found at last! Hurrah!</p>

<p>Pipe turned eagerly upon Sergeant True.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"The door, the door!" he cried, "where is the door
of the old hag's cave?"</p>

<p>Blythe sprang forward, grasped Tigrina by the arm
until she fairly winced under the pressure, and exclaimed,
"are they alive?&mdash;are they safe? Speak!"</p>

<p>"Both!" was the answer.</p>

<p>The cool, clear voice of Captain Clearview broke in
upon the excitement. "Come, my friends, this is not
wise. You are giving way to hopes that may be dashed
from you. What have you to rely upon for them all?
The word of an old Pixinee condemned to death. I
think she has spoken truly. But let us make sure
before we show our joy. First of all, take that flute
from her and bind her arms securely. We will take her
with us into the cave. If she has not deceived us we
will be true to her. If this is all mockery and deceit&mdash;"
There was no need to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>By this time Pipe, True and Blythe had the mossy
door of the cave pushed open. They entered the silk
lined vestibule, and saw the tunnel sloping away into
the hill until lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>"A ladder and lanterns!" cried Pipe. "Haste&mdash;away!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Sir!" answered a half dozen hearty voices.
The sailors flew to the boat, and soon returned with a
rope ladder and several fox-fire lanterns.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready?" asked True.</p>

<p>"Ready!"</p>

<p>"Come on then! and God speed the search!"</p>

<p>He stepped into the mouth of the cave bearing aloft
one of the lights. Pipe and Blythe followed. Then
came Clearview and Help leading Dame Tigrina.
Several sailors brought up the rear of the party. The
remainder of the crew kept guard at the entrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark!" The word fell from the lips of both the
imprisoned Nurses at once. There was a sound as of the
wind blowing through the long tunneled hall that led
into their room. It came nearer. It grew louder. The
maidens stood still straining every nerve to resolve the
meaning of the strange noises. There could be no doubt,
at last, that it was the sound of approaching footsteps,
mingled with voices.</p>

<p>"O Sophie, it is Spite the Spy!"</p>

<p>"O Faith, the Pixie chiefs have returned!"</p>

<p>With a cry of anguish they threw themselves into
each other's arms. In this movement the stand bearing
the "Book of the Wisdom of the Pixies" was overturned,
and with a great racket fell to the floor. The
large volume opened its folios as it fell, and lay spread
out upon its face under the stand.</p>

<p>The scream of the Nurses and the crash of the
stand were answered by a cry from without. The curtain
door of the chamber was rent aside, and Sergeant
True bearing aloft his fox-fire torch entered. Ere he
could utter a word the boatswain darted past him.
Sophia had sprung forward at the first vision of her
lover, and found herself clasped in her father's arms!
Faith had fallen upon her knees. The drapery of her
gown streamed backward partially covering the gilt and
silken bindings of the Pixies' Book of Unbelief. The
hands of the kneeling Nurse, just as they were outstretched
toward Heaven, were clasped in the fervent
grasp of Adjutant Blythe, who in a moment was kneeling
at Faith's side.</p>

<p>It was a striking and tender scene&mdash;the kneeling figures
of Blythe and Faith; Sophia fast locked in her
father's embrace; True standing nearby, the central
figure of the group, holding his torch aloft, gazing upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
his betrothed with joy and fondness shining through the
tears upon his cheek. Crowded in the door and just
within the room, were the other members of the searching
party, in the midst of whom stood Tigrina casting
alternate looks of anger upon the Brownies, and desire
upon the flute which had fallen from Blythe's hand and
rolled quite near her.</p>

<p>Why should we dwell upon what followed? The
mutual greetings, the quick exchange of experiences, the
outbreak of emotion, joy, gratitude, love&mdash;these are
better left to the reader's imagination. One may be
certain, however, that the party did not long stay inside
the Pixie's cave. To be sure, it was a snug place, and
would have been quite safe, and no doubt more comfortable
to the Nurses than the rude accommodations of the
Brownie bivouac outside. But the very sight of Aranea
Hall, even with all its beautiful furnishings, was hateful
to them. They insisted upon going away from the place
with all haste.</p>

<p>"It is a prison, a miserable prison, however much it
may be decked like a palace," exclaimed Faith. "Let
us out of it, immediately!"</p>

<p>"Aye," said Sophia, "with all its silken tapestry,
carpets, and couches it is a den of Pixies, a loathsome,
dismal dungeon. Take us out of it, take us quickly!"</p>

<p>The happy company returned along the tunnel, and
mounted to upper air. A second greeting awaited the
rescued fairies from the party that guarded the entrance.
The boisterous joy of the Brownie sailors could hardly
be restrained. But an urgent warning of the danger
that might be called down upon their newly found loved
ones, by discovering their presence to the Doubters on
the island, kept the outbreaking happiness within bounds.</p>

<p>The Brownies were true to Tigrina and left her safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
within the cave in possession of the coveted flute. But
they fastened the cavern door and mounted a guard over
it. Then a shelter was provided for the Nurses. As
willing hands and happy hearts make light work, the
night was not far gone ere a tent of leaves was built.
Tired out with excitement Faith and Sophia were quite
ready to retire when all was prepared for them. How
happy, happy, happy they were as they lay down to
sleep in each other's arms! Their joy rippled over
their lips in whispered congratulations and thanks, and
bubbled forth in grateful tears. Then soft deep sleep,
the sleep of the good and happy stole gently upon them.</p>

<p>It was long before the Brownie sailors settled to sleep.
Weary as they were, the wish to hear the story of the
capture and imprisonment of the Nurses, was stronger
than the need of rest. Thus, Pipe, True, and Blythe,
to whom the particulars had been told, had to tell them
over and over again. At length all were satisfied; the
sentinels were stationed, the reliefs appointed, and sleep
fell upon the little camp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="chapname">THE HAUNTED GROUND.</p>


<p>Our story must now go back to Big Cave Camp on
the Orchard shore of Lake Katrine. Lieutenant MacWhirlie
had made a vigorous attack upon the Pixie
camp, using his portable davids with good success. He
completely demolished a bowl-shaped battery of Linyphia,<a name="FNanchor_AZ_52" id="FNanchor_AZ_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_52" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a>
placed among the morning glories, from which a
gang of Pixies had kept up a continuous and annoying
volley of spears and arrows. But not being supported
by the infantry, he fell back to the outer line
of intrenchments. Here he was joined by Captain
Bruce with his troops.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Commodore Rodney and his fleet
had retired before the Stygians, and lay under the protection
of the great guns mounted at the mouth of the
inlet. The Pixie squadron took position before the
inlet, thus shutting the Natties in, and Admiral Quench
immediately sent three ships to relieve Big Cave Camp.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood on the eventful evening that
brought such happy issue to the Brownies on Ellen's
Isle. Exciting incidents also had happened at Camp
Lawe, as the Brownie encampment before Big Cave
had been called, in honor of the Ensign's gallant exploit.
Shortly after nine o'clock, the hour for changing
the sentinels, Bruce was informed by Vigilant, the Sergeant
of the guard, that one of the men was missing
from his post.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>"What," cried Bruce in angry tones, "I didn't
think we had a traitor or a coward in our camp. Bring
the wretch here, as soon as he is found. He must suffer
the penalty." The Captain thus spoke, because it is an
almost unheard of thing that a Brownie soldier should
desert his post, and the punishment for such offence is
instant death.</p>

<p>"But, Captain," answered Vigilant, "we have searched
for the guard, and can't find him. No one has seen him
off his rounds. Indeed, he was seen at his post by
the nearest sentinel but a few moments before the relief
came up. Here is his spear, which was picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
up on the ground. Otherwise there is not a trace of him
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Remarkable indeed! Who was the sentinel?"</p>

<p>"Private Standwhile."</p>

<p>"Ah, a good man and true! I know him well. Lead
the way to his picket post."</p>

<p>The two were soon upon the ground. The spot where
the missing soldier's lance was found was carefully examined,
but there was no trace of conflict or other
unusual occurrence. The approaches to the picket line
from the enemy's direction were closely scanned. Nothing
suspicious was seen. The ground for some distance
between the Pixie and Brownie camps was at this point
flat and smooth. Unable to solve the mystery, the
Captain ordered another sentinel to be placed.</p>

<p>"See that he is a good man, one of the brightest and
most careful in the ranks," said Bruce. Accordingly
Sergeant Vigilant assigned Private Sharpsight to the
vacant post.</p>

<p>"And, be sure, Sergeant," said the Captain, as he
turned away, "that you keep a bright lookout upon
your sentinels during the watch, especially on this one."</p>

<p>Scarcely an hour had passed ere Captain Bruce heard
the sharp challenge of the sentinel before his tent door:
"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Vigilant of the picket guard."</p>

<p>Bruce rose from his couch without waiting to be
called, and left the tent. "Well, what is it? Speak!"</p>

<p>"The second sentinel is gone!"</p>

<p>"Sharpsight gone?"</p>

<p>"Aye; not a sign or sound of him anywhere. I
visited the picket once within an hour after he was
stationed. All was then well. But I felt restless and
nervous about the disappearance of Standwhile, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
few moments ago returned. Sharpsight had vanished as
mysteriously as the other!"</p>

<p>"Call out the guard!" cried Bruce, snatching his
broadsword and striding off toward the picket line.
"Keep this matter as quiet as possible. It won't do to
alarm the camp."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 111.&mdash;&quot;The Horizontal Snare of a Young Uloborus Among the Laurels.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Every bush, and clump of grass, weed, stone, stock,
or other place that could possibly give shelter to friend
or foe, Brownie or Pixie, within a wide circuit of the
fatal picket post, was thoroughly explored. Nothing
more dangerous was found than the horizontal snare of
a young Uloborus among the laurels and a few young
Furrow spiders. The latter lay within their silken tubes
which were snugly embosomed within a dainty tuft of
dry moss, or tucked within the folds of rolled leaves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
curled birch bark, with a trap line strung from the
openings to nearby round webs. The Brownies were no
wiser than before. The mystery was unsolved.</p>

<p>"Shall we place another picket?" asked Sergeant
Vigilant.</p>

<p>"It must be done," answered the Captain. "But call
for volunteers."</p>

<p>"You see how it is, my good fellows," said the Sergeant
turning to the guard. "Two of our men are
gone. Where, how, nobody knows. There is foul play
somewhere, and the sort that leaves no trail. The next
picket may uncover the villainy, or he may go the way
of the others. I shall not draft
any one to this post unless necessary.
Who will volunteer?
Step out!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 112.&mdash;&quot;Snugly Embosomed Within a Dainty Tuft of Dry Moss.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>There was a moment's pause.
The sentinels cast glances from
one to another, as though each
waited for his comrade to volunteer.
Then, as if by one
impulse, every one stepped to
the front.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the Captain. "It is just what I
expected of you. But I only meant to test your courage.
I shall take this post myself, and do duty for the
rest of this watch as one of the picket guards. Sergeant,
dismiss the men and resume your rounds. Call here in
half an hour. I will solve this mystery, if it can be
done. Away!"</p>

<p>Vigilant and his guard began to remonstrate with
their leader against this exposure of his life. But when
he bade them away in such peremptory tones, they knew
that his mind was made up, and there was nothing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
them but to obey. Slowly and unwillingly they withdrew;
not to sleep however, but to talk in subdued
voices over the strange events of the night, and await
the issue of their Captain's watch.</p>

<p>The half hour had well nigh passed. A cry of alarm
startled the guard. It ran through the camp. Officers
and men sprang from their bivouac fires and rude
couches, and seized their arms.</p>

<p>"Fall in! Fall in!" shouted the officers. The bugle
sounded the call.</p>

<p>"Is it a night attack?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Where have the Pixies assaulted the line?"</p>

<p>"There! Don't you see the guard rallying in yonder
open space by the ridge. The enemy is coming straight
over the plain."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! There's not a Pixie in sight. It's a false
alarm raised by some stupid picket."</p>

<p>Thus backward and forward ran question and answer,
as the Brownie soldiers swiftly fell into line of
battle.</p>

<p>"Where is the Captain?" asked Lieutenant MacWhirlie,
saluting Acting-Adjutant Bright.</p>

<p>"At the picket line I believe, Sir," answered Bright,
"looking after the cause of the alarm. Ah! here comes
the Sergeant of the guard. Why&mdash;in Heaven's name,
Vigilant, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Captain&mdash;Bruce&mdash;is&mdash;gone!" said the Sergeant,
jerking out the words between sobs.</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;what do you mean?" cried both officers at
once. The story was soon told. The Captain had disappeared
as mysteriously as the two privates. Lieutenant
MacWhirlie after a brief consultation with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
officers issued the following order: "Let the soldiers be
informed of everything. Appeal to their honor, loyalty,
courage and good
sense. Dismiss them to
their quarters, and bid them
sleep upon their arms.
Come, Sergeant, lead the
way to the picket line."</p>

</div>

<p>Accompanied by Vigilant,
the Lieutenant strode
away, having sent back his
pony to the corral. The
men of the guard were still
scattered throughout the
neighborhood looking for
traces of their lost commander
and comrades. They
were recalled by a bugle.
There was nothing to report.</p>

<p>Meanwhile MacWhirlie
carefully examined the
premises. The open space
in front of the mysterious
picket post ended in a low
ridge which ran for some
distance in either direction,
and was covered with grass
intermixed with tufts of
moss and ferns. Beyond
that and toward Camp
Lawe the ridge was covered
with a growth of young
bushes. It was close up to this ridge that the lost pickets
had been stationed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you observe the position of the men?" asked
MacWhirlie.</p>

<p>"Not of the first one," answered the Sergeant. "But
the second was stationed here. So also was the Captain.
They both stood with their faces toward the plain&mdash;outward.
I watched them both from a distance, after I
had left them. The Captain paced up and down, just
there along the ridge, keeping his eyes toward the
enemy's camp. He made a half face outward, so to
speak, as he walked."</p>

<p>"Outward? You are quite sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall take this post now. You will
form the entire guard in a circle enclosing this spot."</p>

<p>"How far away, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Just far enough to have me well in sight. Let the
men pace their beats as ordinary sentinels, keeping each
other in view, face to face and right about. At the
slightest call or alarm of any kind let them close in
instantly, all of them at a sharp run."</p>

<p>"Is that all, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; except that I want you to report to me as
soon as the men are placed. You may go, now."</p>

<p>"Fall in. Attention. Right face. Forward&mdash;March!"</p>

<p>The Sergeant marched away at the head of his squad,
and was soon stationing the sentries according to orders.
As the guard moved off MacWhirlie overheard muttered
words of protest dropping from the soldiers' lips. "Can't
afford to lose both our leaders!" "It's a useless sacrifice!&mdash;Haunted
ground!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" exclaimed the Lieutenant to himself.
"Haunted ground, indeed! The cause of this deviltry
is somewhere in this neighborhood, I'll be bound. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
there's nothing more ghostly than Pixies at the bottom
of it. There's no keeping track of their tricks. We
are forever coming across some new tribe, with new
habits. Their cunning and skill are beyond belief."
He turned his back toward the plain and his face toward
the ridge, and in that position kept guard until Sergeant
Vigilant returned.</p>

<p>"Now," said MacWhirlie, "I want you to take your
stand a few rods beyond me in the direction of the Big
Cave. Keep your eye on me closely. If anything
unusual occurs give the alarm, no matter what it may
be. Don't fear to raise a false alarm."</p>

<p>The long watch began. Keeping his face steadily
inward, the Lieutenant stood, or walked slowly back
and forth, covering his eyes and scanning closely every
object before him. Not a motion of leaf, twig, blade of
grass, sprig or frond escaped his keen vision. But there
was no sign of anything threatening or unusual. Midnight
passed. One&mdash;two&mdash;three o'clock! The first glint
of the coming dawn began to show in the horizon. The
Brownie camp was as silent as a graveyard, for the men
had grown tired of their long suspense, and dropped
asleep. MacWhirlie and his guard were also well nigh
wearied out. The day was like to break leaving the
mystery unsolved.</p>

<p class="chapname">THE DISENCHANTMENT.</p>


<p>Lieutenant MacWhirlie had now almost come to
doubt so much of his theory as located the unknown
enemy within the picket line. But he was a persistent
person, and disliked to give up his theory until he had
something better to lay hold of. Moreover, as he still
believed the Pixies to be the cause of the late misfortunes,
and as he knew they were wont to be quite active
about the peep of day, he resolved to bide by his voluntary
watch a little longer. He beckoned Sergeant
Vigilant to his side and the two sat down to rest among
the delicate ferns that covered the ridge. They went
over again the events of the night, putting this and that
together, in order to frame some intelligent theory for
their guidance. MacWhirlie, however, could find nothing
to shake his first conclusion.</p>

<p>"The danger must have come upon them unawares,"
said he; "it was clearly in every case a complete surprise.
If an enemy had approached from the front, he
would have been spied in time for an alarm. A surprise
so thorough could only have come from the direction
of our own camp, as that was the only quarter not
carefully watched."</p>

<p>The Sergeant's reply was arrested by a curious phenomenon.
The ground beneath them seemed to be
trembling; it raised slowly, swayed back and forth, and
then sank down. The Brownies jumped to their feet
and MacWhirlie exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that? Did you notice the shaking of the
earth? or was it only the grass rocking in the wind?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it seemed to be an earthquake," answered
Vigilant. "There! I
feel the ground again
trembling beneath us."</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;"><a name="Fig_117" id="Fig_117"></a>
<img src="images/fig_117.jpg" width="275" height="231"

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 117.&mdash;A Trap-door Opened.</span>
</div>

<p>The earth had, indeed,
begun to lift up like a
wave; higher and higher
it rose, until the officers,
finding that they were
losing their perpendicular,
flung themselves
backward, in true
Brownie fashion, into a bush on the summit of the
ridge.</p>

<p>"See!" cried MacWhirlie, clasping the Sergeant by
the arm, "there is the enchantress
of your haunted
ground!"</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;"><a name="Fig_118" id="Fig_118"></a>
<img src="images/fig_118.jpg" width="275" height="310"

title="Fig. 118.&mdash;A Trap-door Closed." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 118.&mdash;A Trap-door Closed.</span>
</div>

<p>A trap-door had opened
in the ground, and out of
the crevice a huge chocolate-brown
Pixie was
stealthily peeping! The
door was semi-circular in
form, its edge beautifully
beveled and covered with
fine white silk, and fitted
into the ground as smoothly
as a cork into a flask. The top was covered with grass
and ferns of the same kind as those on the ridge, so
that the keenest eye could not detect the difference. A
hinge of strong silk cloth held the trap-door to the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
side of the ridge. All this the Brownies took in at a
glance.<a name="FNanchor_BA_53" id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a></p>

<p>They crouched motionless in the bush, concealed by
the leaves, but having a full view of the monster who
was slowly emerging from the tubular burrow under the
trap. The creature was the largest of the Pixie race
that either of the officers had seen. She was several
times the size of Spite or Hide, and compared to the
Brownies was as an elephant to a child. She was
covered with a fur robe of a uniform brownish-red color,
fringed with black. Her fangs were huge tusks, her
feet immense brushes armed with sharp claws. Woe to
the enemy that fell within her power! The Brownie
officers had as brave hearts as
ever beat under uniform, but the
wonder upon their faces was
somewhat touched with terror
as they looked from this monster
into each other's eyes. There
could be no mistake about it.
This was the great giantess Cteniza, the Queen of the
Pixies!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_119.jpg" width="200" height="135" alt="Fig. 119.&mdash;Peep-oh! Pixie!" title="Fig. 119.&mdash;Peep-oh! Pixie!" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 119.&mdash;Peep-oh! Pixie!</span>
</div>

<p>The giantess turned, clambered up the ridge and made
straight for the bushlet wherein the Brownies were hid.
They grasped their swords and silently waited. Cteniza
reached the bush. She stretched up an arm to&mdash;seize
the Brownies? No! she fastened a strong cord to a
twig and pulled it taut. The trap-door of her cave
slowly raised until it stood ajar. Then another line was
made fast to the bush and carried over to the top of the
door. The trap swung in this wise and thus allowed the
Pixie queen to enter her den when she wished to return.
This done, she went down the ridge, gazed around her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and began spreading a thick snare over the ground
round about the trap-door.<a name="FNanchor_BB_54" id="FNanchor_BB_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a> She had not seen the
Brownie officers at all.</p>

<p>"We are safe this time," whispered MacWhirlie to
Vigilant, "but what shall we do? It would be folly
for two of us, or even the whole guard, to attack that
creature without some great advantage on our part."</p>

<p>"We must wait and watch," was the answer. "Our
action must depend upon the Pixie queen's."</p>

<p>"Aye, Aye," responded the Lieutenant, "but there is
one thing I have settled. These cords shall be cut and
the monster shut out from her den. If there is any
hope at all for the recovery of our Captain and comrades
it lies in that. Come what may the giantess shall never
get back into her cave; at least until we have had a
a chance to explore it."</p>

<p>Queen Cteniza had by this time finished her snare of
strong cords, and a smooth silken sheet stretched irregularly
upon the grass. She gazed contentedly upon her
work, cast a glance upon her trap-door swinging snugly
by its lines, and set off in the direction of the Pixie
camp. She stopped suddenly. She had caught sight
of one of the sentinels in the outer circle of guards, and
at the same moment the sentinel saw her. He lifted
his bugle and sounded the alarm.</p>

<p>"Ter-ah! Tra-la, la-lah!"</p>

<p>The answer came like an echo from a score of bugles,
and the air was full of the notes. Cteniza turned and
ran toward her cave. MacWhirlie heaved up his axe
and struck a double-handed blow. One of the lines
which held up the trap was severed. Again he struck.
The second line parted and down fell the trap with a
heavy thud, just as the giantess reached it. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
shut out from her cave! A glance showed her the cause
of her misfortune, and then her huge form shook with
rage. She leaped upon the ridge. But by this time the
Brownie officers were well away in hot flight, and the
circle of guards was rapidly closing around them. A
stir throughout the Brownie camp beyond showed that
a general alarm had been sounded, and the whole army
was falling into line. But could the devoted officers
and their little band escape destruction?</p>

<p>"Stand!" cried MacWhirlie. He himself stopped
short in his flight and faced toward Cteniza, who was
pressing forward with uplifted claws and clattering
tusks. Vigilant stopped and stood beside his Lieutenant.
The sentinels gathered around them. Scarce a
dozen of them! It seemed as if the Pixie might crush
them all at a blow.</p>

<p>"Attention!" called the Lieutenant. "There is but
one chance left us. We must skirmish with this monster
as best we can until the troops come up. Mark
those bushes to the right and left. Ready! Vault!"</p>

<p>MacWhirlie gave these commands in sharp, rapid
tones that seemed to impart his own spirit to the sentinels.
Cteniza had approached within half a bow shot
of the Lieutenant as the final order was given. At the
word "vault," every Brownie disappeared into the
foliage of the bushes to right and left, and there perched
on the outer leaves with bows and spears in hand.</p>

<p>The giantess paused and stood with raised arms, rampant
and threatening. She panted with anger and exertion.
She looked to this side and that, before her, behind
her, but saw no sign of her enemies. From the top
of a tall clump of grass above her MacWhirlie's voice
called: "Fire!" Cteniza started; a lance had struck
her face; an arrow had cut through her shaggy robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and broke flesh upon the abdomen; a dozen other weapons
bounded back harmlessly from the chest, or frayed the
skin upon arms and legs. She leaped upon the clump
of grass whence MacWhirlie had issued the order. The
stalks bent down so quickly under the great weight, that
the bulky creature sprawled upon the ground. The
Lieutenant was shaken from his perch, and rolled in the
dust beside the Pixie, but at once regained his feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/fig_120.jpg" width="343" height="400" alt="Fig. 120.&mdash;A Rampant Tarantula." title="Fig. 120.&mdash;A Rampant Tarantula." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 120.&mdash;A Rampant Tarantula.</span>
</div>

<p>"Rally!" he cried, and the soldiers ran to his side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Cteniza now stood looking at her tiny foes. It seemed
like a battle between a lion and a litter of mice, so vast
was the difference in size between the combatants. In
this moment of peril to the devoted band there was a
new arrival upon the scene. Ensign Lawe having left
camp for Hillside, the command of the cavalry fell to
Sergeant Goodnews when MacWhirlie came into chief
command after Bruce's disappearance. Goodnews was
one of the most famous among the Brownie officers.
There was not a fairy in the whole nation so comely in
appearance, so valiant in fight, so efficient in all military
action, so wise in council, so cheerful, amiable and kind
in disposition. Never were beauty and sweetness so well
combined with valor and might.</p>

<p>His charger was a goodly sized wasp, whose name was
Formosa, commonly shortened into the nickname of
"Moz." The creature was thoroughly trained, apt in
every duty of war, and devoted to her master. In
motion she was the swiftest of all the troop. She had a
complete armor, and carried a spear charged with a deadly
sting, which she well knew how to use against her
master's foes. This was the new arrival. Hurrying up
behind Goodnews came a squad of mounted Brownies,
and beyond these again the remainder of the army. But
they would be too late! What could one soldier do,
however brave and well mounted, to save the Brownie
sentinels from the monster who was in the act of throwing
herself upon them? We shall see.</p>

<p>As the giantess sprang upon the little group of guards,
a volley of arrows and spears flew into her face. But
these wrought small harm, and ere the sentinels could
leap aside three of them had been torn to pieces. Vigilant
was wounded and borne to the earth; MacWhirlie
was disarmed and dashed to one side, bruised and sorely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
bedraggled. It was at this moment, when the giantess
was turning fiercely upon her prostrate foes, that Goodnews
flew to the rescue upon his gallant Formosa. His
sabre cut clean and strong across Cteniza's eyes, as he
passed at full speed. He wheeled and rode back again.
What is he doing? He is hovering above the Pixie
queen, skillfully avoiding all her mad efforts to grapple
with him. Is he only seeking to turn her attention from
his friends? At least, he is making no attempt to use
his sabre.</p>

<p>Ah! his tactics are plain enough now. Formosa circles
around the dazed giantess a moment, and then darts
upon her back. The wasp's bright lance flashes in the
light, then horseman and steed are away again like the
wind. And what is this? Cteniza reels upon her feet.
She has fallen over upon her face. She is motionless.
The fatal armor of Sergeant Goodnews' good nag has
done the work. The poison within the sting ran instantly
throughout the bulky frame of the Pixie queen, and
there she lay prone and powerless.<a name="FNanchor_BC_55" id="FNanchor_BC_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_55" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a></p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted MacWhirlie leaping up in spite
of his bruises, and gaily swinging his broadsword. "We
are saved! The Queen is dead! We can save the
Captain now! if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah! that if!</p>

<p class="chapname">OUT OF THE PIT.</p>


<p>The dayspring had begun to streak the east when
MacWhirlie, with a chosen band of Brownies, stood
again before the closed trap-door of Cteniza's cave. The
silken cords which had held the door open were still
clinging to it. The ends which the Lieutenant had cut
away were now gathered up, and the Brownies vainly
sought to pull the door open by main strength.</p>

<p>"Away!" bade MacWhirlie: "call another company
to our aid. And send a windlass."</p>

<p>Soon a second company arrived, bringing ropes and a
windlass. The latter was a rough machine, a straight
twig resting within two upright forked twigs, and having
spokes thrust into and around its projecting ends. The
windlass was planted on the ridge, a cord wound around
the twig, and fastened at the free end to moss growing
upon the trap-door. A bevy of Brownies seized the
spokes and began pushing and pulling with might and
main. Some took the ends of the spokes and threw
themselves downward, carrying the windlass around by
their momentum; others braced their backs against one
another, and with feet upon the spokes pushed right
merrily. Brownies are apt to make a frolic of their
work, and even on an occasion so serious, their capers
could not be quite suppressed. The two ropes were also
fastened to the trap-door and manned by a troop of
soldiers. A cheery call went up from the Lieutenant!</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;ee&mdash;oh! Pull away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>The Brownies at the ropes responded in a sort of
chant: "He&mdash;oh! a long pull; he&mdash;oh! a strong pull;
he&mdash;oh! a pull all together, oh!" At each cadence
the busy workers put forth all their strength. The trap
began to move. Higher&mdash;higher! It was soon fairly
above the ground. Workers were stationed below to
thrust props into the opening as the door rose. A goodly
distance was cleared at last. New props were added.
The trap stood ajar, and the mouth of the burrow was
exposed to view.</p>

<p>"Now, men," said MacWhirlie,
"this is my adventure.
I shall lead
the way into the
pit. Sergeant
Rise
and Corporals
Hope
and Shine shall
go with me. Let
the rest be ready
for any order
or emergency.
Bring ladders
and lanterns."</p>

<p>Both were
ready; the rope ladders were hung upon the edge of the
burrow one on each side. MacWhirlie stepped upon
one, battle-axe in hand, and was followed by Corporal
Shine. Sergeant Rise led the way upon the other, followed
by Corporal Hope.</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ready!"</p>

<p>"Come on, then, and mind the signals."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 122.&mdash;A Clod Containing the Silken Nest of the California Trap-door Spider.</span>
</div>

<p>Hope and Shine had ropes fastened to their bodies, by
which signals could be sent aloft. They also had their
bugles hung loosely, with which to sound the alarm, and
give necessary orders. Down, down into the cave
the Brownies
went. The
light of day
was left
behind
them; all
was dark,
except
where the
lanterns
shed a
narrow circle
of light.</p>

<p>A cry of
horror broke
from MacWhirlie.
On the sides
of the cave hung
the forms of two
Brownies. They
were fastened by silk
ropes to the silken
lining of the tunnel,
and swung stark and
cold. They were
dead.</p>

<p>"Who are they?"
cried Hope, as he
peered through the
glimmering light to recognize, if possible, the dead sentinels.
"Is the Captain there?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>The explorers' hearts were very heavy. It was sad
enough, however it might turn out. But oh! if their
beloved leader should come to this end?</p>

<p>"Is it the Captain?" echoed Rise and Shine.</p>

<p>MacWhirlie, who was nearest the swinging corpses,
had been scanning them closely. He made out the one
nearest him. "This is Sharpsight&mdash;beyond a doubt.
The other is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, the other?&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the dim light it was difficult to determine. Bruce
and Standwhile were very like in form and stature, and
there were few marks in the Brownie uniform by which
men could be distinguished from officers.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;is&mdash;Standwhile!" The decision was given
slowly, but confidently. Yes, the sentinels were gone,
but the Captain was yet to be found.</p>

<p>"We must send our poor comrades aloft," said MacWhirlie,
"before we go further. Pull the signal rope,
Hope. And have the ladder shifted a little nearer the
bodies."</p>

<p>Hope was soon aloft, and down again; the ladder was
shifted, the dead sentinels fastened to the ropes, and
hoisted slowly out of their charnel house. Down in the
cave the groans and cry with which the corpses of their
comrades were greeted, were heard by the little band of
devoted explorers. Once more the ropes were lowered,
were fastened as before, and the Brownies pushed on in
the darkness. They reached the bottom of the cave at
last. Not a sound was heard save the echoes of their
own voices in the hollow depth. There were carcasses of
huge insects, and legs, wings, and heads thereof scattered
over the floor. The Brownies stumbled over these at
every step. Not a sign of the Captain!</p>

<p>Around and around they went, sounding the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
with their axes, cutting away the silken tapestry here
and there. There was clearly but one chamber; no
secret doors or inner rooms at that point at least.</p>

<p>"Then we must look higher up," said the Lieutenant.
"There must somewhere be a branch tunnel, in which
the Captain, living or dead, has been stored away. Look
sharp, my men."</p>

<p>Up they clambered, scrutinizing at every round the
circular wall of the cave. They reached the point where
the dead sentinels had hung. Some unevenness in the
surface here caught MacWhirlie's quick eyes. He struck
the end of his battle-axe upon the wall. Hark! there
was a faint echo within. The place was hollow! He
smote again; a third time the axe fell; but ere it
reached the wall a door opened so violently that it
struck and put out the lantern in the Lieutenant's hand.
Fortunately, as it proved, the axe blade fell upon the
bevel of the door, and was thereby wedged into the
opening, leaving the door slightly ajar.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Rise.</p>

<p>"One of the brood of the Pixie queen," answered
the Lieutenant. "I caught a glimpse of the creature's
claw and fangs as the trap-door opened. It is a young
giant. Our Captain is inside this branch, and this
Pixie prince is guarding him. Here, lay hold of the
trap!" Rise and Hope joined their comrades upon the
ladder. Slits were cut in the tapestry, and seizing the
fragments the Brownies tugged with utmost strength
to pull open the door. It was hung so loosely that it
ought to have opened almost of its own weight; yet the
Brownies could not move it.</p>

<p>"The Prince is holding it against us,"<a name="FNanchor_BD_56" id="FNanchor_BD_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a> said MacWhirlie.
"We must have help from above. Quick!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
fasten these ropes into the slits upon the door. There,
that will do finely. Now, aloft, Hope! Let the men
above pull upon these ropes. Brace them back when
you find them giving away enough, and fasten them
firmly. Then descend, and bring my two-edged sword
with you, old 'Charity.'"</p>

<p>These orders were obeyed with amazing rapidity.
Hope inspired his fellows with the news that the Captain
might yet be found. But, withal, there was a cloud
upon many faces. It
seemed hard to be up
there pulling at ropes,
while a blow was to be
struck for their Captain's
liberty. And
then, was their noble
Lieutenant, their leader
now, to risk his life
in that cave with so
few to support him?
The Pixie prince was
a youth, it was true;
but a giant nevertheless, and a match for a whole company
of the best Brownies.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 123.&mdash;The California Trap-door Spider (Cteniza Californica).</span>
</div>

<p>The messenger who had gone down with MacWhirlie's
sword returned with an order that pacified this discontent.
Two more ladders were to be let down into the
cave. Over these soldiers were to be stationed as closely
as convenient. Thus there were two lines of Brownies
reaching from the surface of the earth to the mouth of
the branch, all ready for any service, and in communication
with the troops above. These arrangements were
soon made.</p>

<p>Then came the signal, "Hoist away!" The ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
tightened; the door began slowly to yield. MacWhirlie
stood upon the ladder close by the edge of the trap,
holding the side ropes with one hand and grasping his
two-edged sword in the other. The Pixie's black claws
came into view; they were fastened upon the inside
cover of the trap, and the whole weight and strength of
the young giant were opposing the opening.</p>

<p>"Hah! Take that then," cried the Lieutenant,
striking upon the exposed claw, which was thus nearly
severed from the arm. The giant released his hold and
backed slowly up the branch. By this time the trap-door
had been well nigh lifted up from the wall, and was
held steady by the ropes above, which were securely fastened.
MacWhirlie entered the open door of the branch
followed closely by Shine, Rise and Hope.</p>

<p>"Fasten your lanterns to the sides," said MacWhirlie.
There were hooks on the handles for such uses, which, by
a single motion of the hand, were caught into the silken
lining, and thence the fox-fire lights threw their glow
into the darkness. Sword in hand the four Brownies advanced,
the Lieutenant in front. The bulky form of
the Pixie prince opposed them. They stood a moment,
silent and prayerful, ere closing to the conflict. They
knew that their lives hung in the balance, and girded
themselves for the issue. Back from the inner darkness,
in that momentary waiting, a voice called faintly:</p>

<p>"Hal&mdash;loo!"</p>

<p>"Hark, my men; it is the Captain!" cried MacWhirlie,
waving his sword, while the cave fairly rang
with his answering shout, "Hello!"</p>

<p>Again the voice came, stronger than before, saying,
"who is there?" It was indeed the voice of Bruce.</p>

<p>"Brownies!" answered the four men in chorus;
"Brownies to the rescue!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_124" id="Fig_124"></a>

</div>

<p>They threw themselves upon the Pixie, smiting face
and breast, arms and legs with swift, strong blows.
Prince Proud (for that was his name) made but a feeble
resistance. Once or twice he stretched out his arms as
though to grapple with his assailants, but the Brownies
easily avoided him, and springing forward again, showered
their sharp blows upon the huge foe. The cause of
this apathy was soon explained; he was just over a
season of moulting, or changing his skin! Several
times before they are grown, Pixies go through this
strange process. The whole outer skin peels off. During
the change the creatures are almost helpless, and lie
still, taking little or no food. After the skin is off, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
takes several days for them to regain their strength.
During the whole time of this change nothing but the
sorest need can stir them up to even as great exertion
as Proud had already made.<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> MacWhirlie saw his advantage
at once. He understood how they had escaped
thus far so easily. His hopes rose into confidence. He
spoke with new cheer.</p>

<p>"Forward, merrily! Sergeant Rise, order in the men
who are on the ladders; I shall cut my way past the
Pixie to the Captain!" He struck upon the Prince's
face, as he ran forward, gave a back-handed stroke as he
passed, and then fairly dodged under Proud's legs and
passed on into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Captain," he called, "Captain!"</p>

<p>"Here!" was the answer from the far end of the
cavern, in the well-known voice of dear old Bruce.
"This way, whoever you are. I am bound hand and
foot."</p>

<p>On, into the darkness the Lieutenant ran, thinking
nothing and caring nothing for obstacles. The little
light at the mouth of the cave was shut out from the
interior by Proud's huge body; but guided by the voice
MacWhirlie strode on through the gloom, and fairly
stumbled at last upon his Captain's prostrate form. In
a moment the keen edge of Charity had cut the silken
cords with which Bruce was swathed, and the strong
arms of MacWhirlie lifted him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" cried the Captain with trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;MacWhirlie!" And throwing his arms
about the captive's neck the brave dragoon sobbed
for joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the darkness of the cave was broken by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
flood of light that relieved even the shadows of that end
of the cavern where Bruce had lain. MacWhirlie
turned. Proud was gone! The Brownies at the mouth
of the cave were in great confusion, some sprawling
upon the floor, some scrambling to their feet, some
swinging by the roof, some hanging to the raised trap-door
and some to the mouth of the cave. In the excitement
of the moment MacWhirlie let go his hold upon
the Captain. The limbs of the unfortunate chief were
so benumbed by his severe handling and the tightness
of the ropes with which he was bound, that he fell upon
the floor.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor Captain," exclaimed MacWhirlie,
"pardon my thoughtlessness!" Without more ado he
lifted the fallen officer in his arms, and started toward
the cave's mouth. Rise, Hope and several others were
already hurrying inward to find their officers. They
met MacWhirlie midway of the cavern staggering under
his burden. A shout of joy burst from their lips at the
sight. It was subdued at once, as the noble fellows
caught sight of their leader's pale face. But the note
had gone on from lip to lip, out of the branch tunnel,
up the walls of the main cavern, along the line of soldiers
who hung upon the ropes, to the group who gathered
around the open door. The sentinels caught up the cry;
it flew from man to man until it reached the camp, and
then, led by the sound of trumpets and the blast of
bugles, the whole wood and valley rang with such a
cheer as never before went up even from Brownie
throats:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Rejoice! Our lost is found!"</p>

<p>The squirrels stopped upon the branches of the trees,
threw their bushy tails above their backs, pricked up
their tiny ears, listened a moment, then joined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
cry of their friends, with merry barking. The birds
stopped in their flight, or alit upon the boughs, perked
their pretty heads to this side and that, as though they
were asking, "what is the matter?" Then they, too,
joined in the shout of their good friends the Brownies,
whistling, trilling, carolling until the air was alive with
songs. The trees clapped their leaf hands together; the
flowers raised their plumed hats; the bees, butterflies
and wasps hummed in chorus with the joyful cry. It
seemed as though all nature had joined in with their
happy friends to celebrate the rescue of Bruce, chief of
the Brownies; and happiest heart of all was that of
Agatha the good.</p>

<p class="chapname">BREAKING CAMP.</p>


<p>The rescued Bruce was carried by his rejoicing friends
and followers to the upper air. The fresh breeze and
bright sunshine wrought like a charm to renew his
strength. The time of his captivity had been short;
but he had been so roughly handled by his giant captors,
and the cords with which he had been bound had
so galled him that he was quite unable to walk. He
was therefore laid upon a leaf stretcher and carried to
his tent. A few words explained the manner of his capture.
He had been surprised by the giantess who rushed
upon him from behind, knocked him senseless by a blow
of her claw, bound him, and then carried him into her
den. The monster had already slain the two sentinels,
sucked their blood, and hung the bodies upon the wall
where they had been found. But Bruce was reserved to
feed the maw of Prince Proud, and was therefore thrust
into the branch cave. As, however, the worthy youth
was "moulting," and in the listless estate which has been
described, the Captain lay in bonds awaiting the revival
of Proud's appetite. To this fact both Bruce and his
gallant rescuers owed their lives.</p>

<p>"But what became of Proud?" The Lieutenant
naturally raised this question after all the party had got
out of the cave.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sergeant Rise, laughing, "he's down
there among the bones at the bottom of the cave, alive
or dead, I don't know which. After you had dodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
by the Prince, we attacked him vigorously, but he did
little more than move back slowly, occasionally striking
out in a blind way. All at once, however, he dashed
forward, and plunged out of the branch into the bottom
of the main cave. We were taken by surprise, and were
sent flying in all directions in an awkward and ludicrous
manner. A score or so of Brownies had just entered
the branch from the ladders, and
they were scattered like leaves in a
whirl-a-wind. Two of them were
thrown upon the Pixie's shoulders,
and went down with him pick-a-back
into the cavern. Fortunately,
they flung themselves off upon the
rope ladders, and so escaped. Indeed,
we all got off pretty well; a
few scratches, bruises and torn
clothes, but nothing serious. It
was about the funniest scrape we
have been in for a long time. We
were taken aback and upset by the
brute's sudden dash."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 125.&mdash;&quot;Moulting.&quot; A Spider Pulling Off Its Old Skin.</span>
</div>

<p>MacWhirlie joined in the hearty
laughter which the recital of the
adventure awakened. "However,
my lads," said he, "it might have
been anything but a comic affair.
See that the trap-door is securely
lashed and fastened down, and guarded. We will look
after the young giant hereafter."</p>

<p>This order given, the Lieutenant was about following
his Captain to the camp when his attention was drawn
to a crowd of curious Brownies gathered around the
carcass of the Pixie queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said he, "I
must see about getting
this thing out of the
way."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/fig_126.jpg" width="187" height="500"
alt="Fig. 126.&mdash;&quot;Moulted.&quot; A Spider Hanging Beneath Its Cast-off Skin."

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 126.&mdash;&quot;Moulted.&quot; A Spider Hanging Beneath Its Cast-off Skin.</span>
</div>

<p>He climbed into a bush
from which he could overlook
at once the crowd
and the bulky form of
the giantess. The greater
part of the Brownies
were gazing upon the carcass,
meanwhile chatting,
in their lively way, over
late events. A small
group of more restless
spirits were bent upon
getting the fangs or tusks
of the immense creature
as trophies. They had
just finished their arrangements
as MacWhirlie
arrived, and armed
with ropes, swords and
axes were scrambling
over Cteniza's legs towards
her face. The legs
and arms were drawn up
around the body as they
had been when death
overtook her. Suddenly
the arms stretched forward
from the face!
The legs shot out backward! "Whew! the Pixie queen
has come to life!" some one shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a scampering as there was! The adventurous
trophy seekers threw themselves by a series of somersaults
from the moving limbs, and Brownies, axes, swords
and ropes went flying in all directions through the air.
The crowd around fell back, pushing, tumbling, clambering
over one another, a panic-stricken mass.</p>

<p>MacWhirlie from his lookout observed this strange
behavior of a dead Pixie with amazement and alarm.
"What, isn't the giantess dead?" he exclaimed. He
expected to see her rise and charge upon the confused
and struggling crowd of Brownies. But ere he could
give a second thought, Cteniza's limbs slowly fell back
into their first position. She made no other motion.</p>

<p>The soldiers rapidly recovered from their panic when
they found they were not pursued; then, in right
Brownie fashion, began to make merry over their own
ridiculous flight. But what were they to think of this
last movement of the Pixie? Wasn't the creature dead?
MacWhirlie left his perch and took charge of affairs.
He was about organizing a fresh attack upon the
giantess, when Sergeant Goodnews rode up astride his
nag Formosa. He had already heard of the strange
behavior of the "corpse," and was ready to explain:</p>

<p>"The fact is, Lieutenant, the Pixinee is not dead, but
you would quite waste your energies in any new attack
upon her. She will surely die. The sting of my Moz
is mortal; but for several days, perhaps weeks, Cteniza
will be just as you see her. She cannot move from that
spot. If you disturb her she will probably stretch out
her limbs; but they will fall back again, without doing
any harm, and in due time the creature will die."<a name="FNanchor_BF_58" id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a></p>

<p>The Brownies were satisfied although the explanation
seemed very strange. But they had well learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
nature's facts are often stranger than fiction, and so
believed the good Sergeant. The giantess was left undisturbed,
and MacWhirlie hastened to camp. Captain
Bruce rapidly recovered his spirits. But his nerves had
received too severe a shock to allow him to resume
active command at once. Yet he could consult with his
officers as to what should now be done, and a council of
war was held in his tent. The reluctant conclusion was
that it would be better to raise the siege of Orchard
Cave, and join the fleet at the inlet. They feared that
the enemy might attack the Brownie forces while
divided, and destroy them. The order was therefore
given to break camp at once.</p>

<p>Amid the stir of preparation for departure, MacWhirlie
had forgotten about the dead giantess. But as the
Brownie troops marched by the late scene of conflict on
their way to the inlet, he was reminded of the incident
by a cry from the vanguard:</p>

<p>"The body of the Pixie queen is gone!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Call Sergeant Goodnews." The
Sergeant reported immediately.</p>

<p>"How is this, Sergeant? It seems that you were
wrong about our giant foe. She has disappeared. The
Brownies haven't carried her off; the Pixies haven't
been near; she must have made off herself. You
surely did not mean to deceive us; but explain if you
can."</p>

<p>The Sergeant gave reins to Moz, and followed by
MacWhirlie on his Bee-pony Buzz, flew straight to the
spot where Cteniza had lain. The bulky carcass was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Now my good Moz," said the Sergeant, "show us
what you know of this mystery." The obedient wasp,
circled around the spot, and then darted into the bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
She soon lit upon an overhanging twig, and folded her
wings as though quite contented with herself.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" cried MacWhirlie.</p>

<p>"Look for yourself," said Goodnews, pointing to the
ground beneath. A mound of fresh earth was thrown
up on the margin of a wide hole out of which came
the sound of rattling clods and fluttering wings.</p>

<p>"What is this? It explains nothing!"</p>

<p>"Wait a wee. There! do you see that?"</p>

<p>A large Pompilus wasp flew out of the hole, which
she at once began to fill with the loose clay heaped
around the edge.</p>

<p>"That is your sexton," said Goodnews; "this is her
newly made grave, and inside you will find the missing
body. The sexton is a full cousin of my Formosa. She
has dragged your giantess here by her own unaided
strength; has dug that grave which you see, and is just
ready to fill it up. Are you satisfied? If not, look for
yourself."</p>

<p>Down flew MacWhirlie to the edge of the grave.
Away went the sexton in alarm. The Lieutenant
peeped into the hole and saw the brown body and limbs
of the Pixie queen already partly covered with pellets
of clay.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," he said, and the two rode away.
"But tell me, what strange fancy could have turned yon
insect into an amateur grave digger?"</p>

<p>"It is not a matter of fancy," replied Goodnews, "but
of those strong, wise natural promptings of motherhood
which men call maternal instinct. If you had lifted one
of the Pixie's limbs you might have found an egg of
the wasp snugly stowed away against the body. In due
time that egg will become a grub with a most ferocious
appetite, and that appetite will find food in the plump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
body of the Pixie queen. That is why nature has given

<p>When the Lieutenant again reached the head of the
column it was about passing the trap-door cave. The
Brownie guards were relieved from duty, and Prince
Proud was left
to his fate. As
the trap had
been pretty
tightly fastened
down,
however, t h e
Brownies had
good hopes
that his fate
would be such
as to deliver
them from
any further
fear on his
account.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the Brownie troops as they
marched to the inlet. First came the cavalry, their
bright trappings and many colored butterfly steeds
making a brilliant spectacle. Next to these rode Sergeant
Goodnews with the color guard, as MacWhirlie
was once more at the head of his troopers, and Ensign
Lawe was still absent. The great flag of Brownieland
was borne by a sturdy dragoon mounted on a Goliath
moth. Behind these came the litter on which Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Bruce was carried. A small downy leaf of silver maple
had been laid upon a mattress woven out of ropes of
grass and fibres of bark. The mattress was slung upon
poles on each side, and these were laid upon the
shoulders of stout Brownies, who thus carried their beloved
Captain quite comfortably. Above the litter a
sunshade, made from the blossoms of a wood violet, was
borne by mounted Brownies. Behind this ambulance,
and indeed directing it, rode the Nurses, Agatha and
Grace, with the assistants and accoutrements of the sanitary
corps. The maidens were pale and worn by the
grief and excitement of the last days, and rode along
sadly, almost silently. A number of litters followed the
sanitary corps, bearing sick and wounded Brownies.
Then came the infantry; and last of all, a squad of
cavalry brought up the rear, the buglers piping merry
notes as they rode along.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 128.&mdash;Brownie Troops on the March.</span>
</div>

<p>The Brownie army did not get away without annoyance
from the enemy. The Wolf Brigade and the
Vaulters hung upon the rear and flanks, annoying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
troops as much as possible. Gossamer and his balloon
corps hovered above, keenly spying the column to note
where an assault might be made. The Wheel Legion
spun cobwebs across the route to entangle the wings of
the cavalry. The Lineweavers and Tubeweavers spread
thick sheets upon the grass to retard the footmen's progress.
The Stygian ships followed the line of march as
nearly as might be, keeping close in shore and watching
for opportunity to work harm. The Watermen, Smugglers
and Pirates
pushed out
from their
grassy hiding
places and
joined in the
pursuit. The
Brownies, however,
were quite used to all these methods of assault, and
knew well how to meet and avoid them. Moreover, a
section of their flying artillery, with guns mounted upon
bee ponies, accompanied the march. They hovered
over the van and rear and above either flank of the
column, and pelted their adversaries with shot from
their portable davids, thus keeping them at a safe distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>Before sunset the inlet was reached, and the army
encamped safely under protection of the big davids
mounted upon the forts built at either cape. One of
these was known as Fort School, the other Fort Home;
and the guns which guarded these were called "Precept"
and "Example," for Brownies are fond of calling all
manner of objects after some favorite fact, person or
virtue among their human friends.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 130.&mdash;Brownie Flying Artillery and Portable David.</span>
</div>

<p>It was pleasant for the soldiers and sailors once more
to be together, and there were warm greetings and happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
reunions. But as they pitched their tents and kindled
their camp-fires on the beautiful and familiar bank of
their beloved stream, their hearts were sad that their
foes already had possession of Lake Katrine; were
swarming along its shores; and, ere morning sunrise,
would have covered the lawn once more with their white
tents, and spread their snares beneath the very windows
of the Wille mansion. Withal, as the Brownies had
learned to take such destiny as befell them with contented
or at least submissive minds, they composed themselves
for the night's rest, and soon were sound asleep.
The sentinels paced the parapets of the forts, peeped
through the fog from the lookouts on shipboard, and
stood watchful and silent on the lonely picket line
beyond camp.</p>

<p class="chapname">THE GRAND ALLIANCE WITH SCALY, TWIST AND SLYMOUSIE.</p>


<p>Next morning the Brownies' forebodings were found to
be well grounded; their enemies held possession of the
lawn. Lake and lawn both in Pixie hands! It was
a sorry day in Brownieland. What could be done?
Not a word as yet had been heard from Ensign Lawe,
and all were uneasy thereat, for they knew that he
would not forget his mission, nor fail of it if success were
possible, nor be likely to fall into the foe's hands. Yet
his absence showed that early aid was not to be looked
for from Governor Wille, and thus hope was cut off from
that quarter.</p>

<p>There were plans enough formed and discussed among
the uneasy spirits of the camp, but only one had practical
issue. Corporal Policy, of the Engineer Corps, proposed
a grand alliance against the Pixies. The Corporal
was not in high favor among the Brownies, although he
was a shrewd fellow, and a useful one too, when kept
well in control by Sergeant True and the other officers.
But in the present gloomy outlook of affairs many were
ready to listen to any counsel that looked toward delivering
the nation from its peril and restoring the Mansion
to Brownie control. It is not strange, therefore,
that the Corporal's proposed alliance was seconded by
many in the camp. A delegation, with Policy at its
head, waited on Lieutenant MacWhirlie, laid the plan
before him and urged its adoption. The plan was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
follows: Policy had once done a great favor to two land
elves, Twist the Serpent, and Slymousie the Quadruped,
and also to Scaly, a water sprite. They had promised
to serve him at any time in any affair. They were
not on good terms with the Pixies at the best and, the
Corporal urged, would be prompt and eager to fulfill
their promise against the common foe.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Policy, "I propose that we organize
an expedition against the Stygians in this wise: let
Scaly fall upon their ships, sink as many as she can with
the stroke of her tail, and drag the rest by their cables
or push them with her head upon the shore. Our troops
and ships can attack them, at this disadvantage, with
certainty of victory. At the same time let Twist and
Slymousie break in upon the Pixie camp, and bite, crush
and destroy. Slymousie is a cunning and active adversary,
and Twist is so much bigger than the Pixies that
they cannot stand before him. Then, there is nothing
like fighting these poison breeding creatures with their
own weapons. Poison to kill poison, say I!" quoth
Corporal Policy; "shrewdness to overcome cunning!
That is true wisdom!"</p>

<p>Thus, and with many other arguments, Policy and his
friends pressed their alliance. MacWhirlie had little
favor for the scheme, as it was contrary to Brownie
nature and custom; but, in sheer desperation, he at last
consented that Policy should take charge of a company
of volunteers and try his plan; especially as he thought
it could work no harm, and would keep some restless
spirits occupied.</p>

<p>The volunteers were readily enlisted and pushed off
hopefully to find the haunts of Dragon Twist, Slymousie
the Quadruped and Sprite Scaly. Twist was soon found
sunning himself upon a limb of a sapling that grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
above the big stone under which he had his nest. When
the party spied him the Corporal mounted upon the rock
and sounded a note or two upon his bugle. Twist slowly
lifted his head above the leaves, flung a coil of his tail
around a twig, looked down and at once recognized his
friend. He hissed forth as pleasant a greeting as he
knew how to give, listened patiently to Policy's request,
looked wise, nodded his head in approval, and at once
promised to do his utmost.</p>

<p>"I will keep faith with you, good fairy," he said, lisping
out the words between tongue and teeth. "You
may depenth upon me to crush out your old enemieth,
body, bag and baggage." Whereupon he wriggled
among the leaves, and took an extra coil or two of his
tail around the twig.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" cried Policy, "and now, when will you
begin operations, and how many of us will you want to
help you?"</p>

<p>"Now, I will begin now!" answered Twist; "and ath
to aid, I athk for none. If a few of you would like to
go with me to thee my triumph over the Pikthieth, come
along! I thall make thort work of it, and you can
come back and thing my praitheth."</p>

<p>The Corporal detailed a squad of his men to go with
Twist, and hurried away to engage the service of Scaly.
The water sprite was not so easily found. Somewhere
in the lake close by the rocks of the cape she had her
favorite haunt. The Brownies swung upon the overhanging
weeds and bushes and peered into the water,
but could see nothing of her. Policy sounded his bugle
in vain. At length a water beetle, of the family known
as Whirligigs, thrust itself out of the lake, and began
capering upon the surface.</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried the Corporal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her-rr-reep!" said the Whirligig, skipping nearer
to the shore.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Scaly the Sprite down below?" asked
Policy, "and would you kindly tell us where she may
be found?"</p>

<p>"Aye, that I can, Mr. Brownie. But what could you
do even if I were to tell you? Would you go down to the
bottom of the lake to speak to her? Ha, ha!" The
little water beetle, who had been joined now by a group
of companions, cut sundry gyrations upon the lake, and
circled round and round in a merry dance with his
friends. Clearly he was much pleased that he was able
to do something which a fairy could not do.</p>

<p>"Come now, Master Whirligig," said the Corporal,
"you must oblige us in this matter. You know that
Brownies are your good friends; and you know that we
can't do what you can. Go and tell Scaly that we want
to see her."</p>

<p>"So I will!" answered the water beetle, good naturedly.</p>

<p>"So we will!" chirped all his companions. Turning
suddenly the whole party plunged into the water, every
one carrying down with him on the tip of the abdomen
a bubble of air to supply him with breath while under
water. They made their way straight to a stone of
quartz whose crystallized sides glittered in the light that
penetrated the stream.</p>

<p>"Sprite Scaly, Sprite Scaly!" called the beetles in
chorus, while they held fast to the rock with their
claws.</p>

<p>A form slowly lifted itself from the shadows under the
edge of the rock and rose higher and higher until it was
quite on a level with the top whereon Whirligig and his
friends sat. It was a fish, with silver-white scales and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
red eyes. She floated in the water, which she lazily
beat with her fins and tail, opening and shutting her
gills, looking all the while very sedate indeed.</p>

<p>"Sprite Scal<i>ee</i>! Ah! here you are!" cried the
beetles as they caught sight of the fish poised above
them. "Brownie Policy sent us down to tell you that
he claims your service. He waits on the shore above.
Good bye!" Up they went without more ado, and in a
moment were again circling around upon the surface of
the lake.</p>

<p>Scaly was not far behind them. Lazy as she looked,
she could dart through the water like an arrow, and
sooner than we tell it, had reached the bank and thrust
her face close to the feet of the Corporal. Policy repeated
his plan and got as hearty assent from Scaly as
from Twist.</p>

<p>"What shall we do to support you?" asked Policy.</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing very 'special," said Scaly,
spitting out half a dozen mouthfuls of water. "The
Natties had better follow up my attack in their own
way. They'll not have much to do but gather up
drowned Pixies, I reckon; or maybe capture some of
their boats as the Stygies make off from their damaged
ships."</p>

<p>The Sprite and the Corporal agreed upon the time for
the attack, and thereupon Scaly turned, gave her tail a
few self-satisfied flops, and dived out of sight.</p>

<p>The third party to the proposed alliance was Slymousie
the Quadruped. "We shall find her in the
field," said Corporal Policy, and sent off several men to
hunt for her. The Brownies climbed the hill back of
the Mansion and by and by found the cave, just on the
edge of the orchard, where Mrs. Slymousie had her nest.
It was quite hidden away beneath the overtopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
meadow grass. A round bunch of chopped and twisted
hay was balled up within it, which made it snug and
warm. The Brownies swung themselves down by the
grass blades and roots until they were well within the
cave, when the Corporal called a halt and blew his
bugle. There was much shrill squeaking down at the
bottom of the nest, and a sudden rustling amid the dry
upholstery, as the youngsters scampered away into hiding.</p>

<p>Once more Corporal Policy blew his bugle, and then
called loudly: "Slymousie&mdash;hello! It's no one but I&mdash;the
Brownie. Hello&mdash;come out and see the Brownie!"</p>

<p>At last a low, timid voice squeaked forth the question,
"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Corporal Policy the Brownie! Don't you know
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! to be sure I know you now. But, dear
me! you nearly frightened me into a fit. I thought it
was Grimalkin the Housecat; or that miserable old Owl
that nests in the hilltop wood. Are you sure&mdash;it's&mdash;only
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Slymousie; don't be absurd! Who else
could it be? I came to claim your help against our
old enemies the Pixies."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! Don't mention it, I pray. What
could I do against those dreadful creatures? It quite
flusters me to think of it, indeed. Besides, I have a
large family now at home; some of them very young;
too young to leave alone. Really, you must excuse
me this time. Dear, dear! My heart is going pit-apat,
pit-apat at the very thought."</p>

<p>Policy was not to be put off so easily, and remained
some time trying to persuade his friend. But he quite
failed, and was about to leave, when who should come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
into the cave but Master Biggy, Mrs. Slymousie's oldest
son by the next-to-last brood. He had been out
on a visit to his sweetheart, and dropped in to see if
mother hadn't a nice bit of cheese, or bumblebee bread,
or some such delicacy for him. He heard enough of
the conversation to excite his love of adventure, and
at once volunteered to take his mother's place.</p>

<p>"Do you think you are old enough to measure
strength with the Pixies?" asked Policy.</p>

<p>"Old enough?" exclaimed Biggy indignantly. "Old
enough, indeed! Look at me, now! I'm nearly as
large as mother, and not half so timid as she. Just
you wait, Sir! You shall see that Biggy Slymousie
is no small affair when it comes to fighting Pixies.
I'm a match for any score of 'em in strength; and as
for slyness&mdash;well, you shall see!"</p>

<p>Biggy was certainly a stout enough specimen of a
half-grown Slymousie, and as he seemed not to be
lacking in spirit, and had a keen mind for the work,
his service was gladly accepted. It was arranged that
he should attack the Pixie force in the rear, while
Twist assaulted in front; and having instructed him
as to the time of assault, and arranged some details,
the Corporal retired with his squad, highly elated at
his success. Thus the grand alliance was formed. We
shall now see what became of it.</p>

<p>When the sun had gone down, the full moon rose.
It poured a flood of rays upon the mansion, lit up the
lawn, and lay like a golden crown on the top of Hillside.
The Pixies were in high glee over their prospects.
Their ships had drawn up around the inlet as
near as they dared to come; their troops had been
ferried across the lake, and were already closing up
the lines of investment around that part of the Brownie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
camp which lay on the side toward the mansion. From
this point the Pixie tents and snares stretched across
the lawn to the flower border by the walk. In this
direction Twist turned his course. He crossed the brook,
holding his head aloft as he wriggled his body through
the water. The Brownies followed on their moth ponies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_131.jpg" width="400" height="331"
alt="Fig. 131.&mdash;The &quot;Bridge That Tetragnatha Had Builded.&quot;"
title="Fig. 131.&mdash;The &quot;Bridge That Tetragnatha Had Builded.&quot;" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 131.&mdash;The &quot;Bridge That Tetragnatha Had Builded.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The Serpent stopped a moment upon the shore, then
dashed at the Pixie breastworks, which broke into fragments
before his assault. Many of the guards were
knocked over by the swoop of his tail, others were
crushed under the coils of his body, others were pierced
through by his sharp fangs. The camp was in consternation.
A broad swath of fallen tents, broken
fortifications and dead Pixies marked the progress of
the mighty Twist, and throngs of fugitives fled across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the brook by a bridge that Tetragnatha had builded,
and which quite reached from shore to shore.</p>

<p>What a small affair serves to turn the tide of events,
at times! A little hop-toad, disturbed by the commotion,
leaped from beneath a cool leaf to ask "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Aha, my beauty," cried Twist, "you're my game!"
and he snapped up toadie in a twinkling. One would
have thought it a painful thing for Twist to eat his
meals, for he writhed, and jerked his body as though he
were in torment. However, he appeared to grow more
comfortable after a while, and stretched himself out on
the grass as though to enjoy a nap.</p>

<p>The Brownies were not pleased to see their friend
the hop-toad dealt with so unceremoniously. The poor
fellow and his brothers had stood by the fairies in many
a stout bout with the Pixies. To be sure the toads
would eat their enemies; but as they never insisted
upon sharing such rations with their friends, the Brownies
made no objections. To have their new ally serve
their old friend in this style was sad work, and their
indignation waxed warm. But when Twist stopped
short in his path, and deliberately composed himself to
rest, the Brownies could not restrain themselves.</p>

<p>"How is this," they cried, "do you mean to leave
off a work so well begun? Come, this is not keeping
faith. Up, and renew the attack! You will rout the
whole Pixie army before sunrise if you keep on."</p>

<p>"Thank&mdash;ee&mdash;kind&mdash;le," drawled Twist, winking first
with one eye and then with the other. "I nev' c'n work
af'r thupper. Muth take time t' digest. Sh'nt do 'nything
till '&mdash;r&mdash;morer. 'M go'n thleep right here. Goo'
night, Thir Brownithz, 'll finish job'n mornin'." His
head dropped down upon the grass; he was sound asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph," said Corporal Spur, who had charge of
the squad, "that ends this campaign. If the Pixies
don't serve that gourmand with a rather peppery sauce
for his supper, I'm out in my reckoning. Attention,
squad! wheel&mdash;fly!" He wheeled his own pony, and
led his little command back to their quarters. As they
flew above the Pixie lines they saw the camp alive with
excited troops swarming from every quarter toward the
spot where Twist lay.</p>

<p>A squad of reckless youngsters who had jointly
mounted the back of a huge Polyphemus moth, could
not resist the temptation to let fly a few arrows at the
crowd of excited Pixies beneath them. One of the
squad, our old friend Highjinks, nearly lost his life, however,
for in his eagerness he tumbled off the pony's back.
Fortunately, Hosson seized one hand and drew him back
safely. But it was a narrow escape, and even Highjinks
was for a time quite sedate as he thought what his
fate would have been had he dropped into the midst of
that angry host of foes. In the excitement, Polyphemus
came quite near the ground, and barely escaped being
lassoed by one of the Vaulting Legion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a circle of Pixies had hemmed in the
sleeping serpent; but no one dared to interfere with
him until Spite came. Then they began to clamor for
orders:</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Do?" said Spite, fairly hissing the answer through
his teeth. "Do? Why, we'll hang the villain!"</p>

<p>"Aha! Captain Spite talks very large, indeed,"
whispered the soldiers one to another. "Who ever heard
of Pixies hanging a serpent?"</p>

<p>At any rate Spite intended to try it now. Already
he had climbed upon a bush that overhung the sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
monster, had fastened a cord to a twig and dropped
down upon his head. Twist moved. Spite retreated
upon his cord, and in a trice was half way up toward
the twig.</p>

<p>"Come back, Captain, you'll lose your life," shouted
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Tut! trust me for that! Why, don't you see? The
brute is dead stupid from his meal, and perfectly
harmless."</p>

<p>Down he ran again. This time Twist did not move.
Spite fastened a line upon his head, dropped down by the
side of his face, and burrowing into the grass, cleared a
path directly under the jaws. Through this he carried
his line, then up again along the opposite side of the face,
and knotted it. He had thus passed a cord entirely
around the serpent's face.</p>

<p>"Now, my braves," said he, "I have shown what I
want you to do, and how to do it. Here, a score of you
wind up these jaws until they are completely gagged.
Another squad may take a knot in his tail, tie it, lash it
to a strong rope, and swing it up to that branch. I'll
show you what more to do. Work sharp, now, and
touch the brute as gently as possible. We shall surprise
him, when he wakes up, with a new suit of clothes.
He, he!"</p>

<p>The Pixinees and Pixies went to work with a hearty
good will, and soon had finished their task.</p>

<p>"Now mount that branch and pull on the rope." The
tail was raised a little, and then the work paused. Nothing
more could be done in that way. "We must rig up
a pulley, then," said Spite. "Bring me a dead fly, quick!"</p>

<p>The carcass of a green fly was readily found. It was
swung down from the branch, and wrapped round and
round until it became a hard silken ball. The rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
which had been tied to the tail was now carried over
this pulley, or windlass as it might be more properly
called. The ball was slowly revolved by the united
strength of a number of Pixies; the rope gradually
wound around it as it grew taut, and the body of Twist
began to move. Thereat the crowd broke into hearty
applause, clapping their fangs and claws together until
the camp rang. The noise appeared to disturb Twist, or
perhaps the effects of his meal were beginning to pass
away. He raised his
head feebly, shook it
from side to side, discovered
that his jaws were
bound tightly together,
and began to wriggle his
body violently, whereat
the circle of Pixies fell
back.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 284px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 132.&mdash;Twist, the Serpent, Hung in the Pixie Snare.</span>
</div>

<p>"Pull lively, lads!"
cried Spite, who was prudently
perched upon the
top of the branch.
"Lively! a few more
turns and we shall have
him all right. There,
that will do bravely.
Now he may squirm as
much as he pleases."
Twist was indeed bound and hung up beyond hope
of recovery, although he was making desperate efforts
to escape.<a name="FNanchor_BH_60" id="FNanchor_BH_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a></p>

<p>"Straighten out that cord, my lads, as much as possible,"
called Spite. "Run up supporting lines to the limb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
here. Fasten down the coils on the ball so that the
rope won't give. Then, hurrah! We'll have a taste of
dragon blood before we go to bed." Spite ran down
upon Twist's body as he spoke, and fastening himself
upon the neck, struck with his fangs again and again.
He then comfortably settled himself for a meal. In the
meantime a number of the working squad had followed
their Captain's example. Poor Twist! he was being
literally devoured alive. Like many other wise persons,
he had fallen a victim to ill-governed appetite.
Thus ended his proud boasts and the campaign most
prosperously begun. A Brownie scout, attracted by the
great commotion in the Pixie camp, stole through the
lines and discovering the cause, returned with the news
which was soon known by all the Brownies at the inlet.
But Spite was not long permitted to enjoy his well-earned
supper. A runner bustled through the crowd
and shouted for the Captain.</p>

<p>"Here I am," answered Spite, quitting his hold upon
Twist's neck and dropping to the ground. "What's the
matter now?"</p>

<p>"Matter enough, Sir! The rear of our camp has been
attacked by young Slymousie, and everything there is in
panic and confusion."</p>

<p>"The prowling sneak! The Brownies have put him
up to it, I warrant. Rally the men! We must try to
drive him back."</p>

<p>Thereupon Spite started at full speed to the rear. He
found affairs quite as bad as they had been reported.
Biggy had cautiously approached the camp and, crawling
low in the grass, slipped by the picket line undiscovered.
Then with a rush and bound he leaped upon a group of
Pixie sentinels who stood at the guard tent talking over
the late incident with Dragon Twist. Unfortunately his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
caution, which is a good trait, was pushed to an undue
degree, which is bad practice in a soldier. The fact is,
that in spite of his boastings, Biggy's heart failed him a
little when he came to face the danger, and thus his approach
was so timid and slow that instead of striking
the Pixie camp, as had been agreed, at the moment of
Twist's assault, he did not attack it until Twist was
fairly over his onset. This proved to be a fatal blunder.</p>

<p>However, when he once began work, he pushed it
vigorously enough. He dispersed the sentinels hither
and thither, broke down their tent and burst into the
midst of the encampment. He struck, pushed and bit
to the right and left, and soon had laid a broad swath
of destruction along his path. In the midst of this high
success he came upon the scattered contents of a bumble-bee's
nest, which the Pixies had been pillaging. It was
a most unlucky circumstance, for all the Slymousie
tribe are fond of bee-bread and honey, and Biggy was
hungry. He stopped, smelled the bee combs, turned
over a few cells with his nose and then began to nibble.</p>

<p>"Just one little taste," he said, "and then I'll go on
with my duty." Ah, Biggy Slymousie, take care! Your
enemies are all around you. This is the time for duty,
not for delicacies. Touch not, taste not, handle not!
The temptation may prove too strong for you!</p>

<p>But Biggy silenced the voice of his better judgment,
and nibbled away. Now, Slymousies are always dainty
and deliberate in their way of eating, which, as a rule,
is quite proper and nice. But when one is in the midst
of a hard and perilous battle, daintiness cannot safely be
indulged. Spite the Spy arrived on the scene just as
Biggy had fairly settled down to enjoy a hearty meal.
With a curse of thorough contempt hurled at the silly
glutton, the Pixie chief began his preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
revenge. He sent for engineers Tegenaria and Agalena
of the Tubeweaver legion, and ordered out Theridion
and his pioneers. The Pixies set to work with a will,
and ere Biggy had finished his meal had completely
surrounded him with a thick, strong and high wall of
web work. While Biggy nibbled, nibbled, the Pixies
spun and wove around him their fatal snares. Poor
Biggy!</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 133.&mdash;&quot;One of Tegenaria&#39;s Thick Snares.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>At last all was ready. The Theridion pioneers were
sent aloft among the overhanging grasses, the Tubeweavers
went to their holes, and those in front of Slymousie
provided themselves with silken blankets. Then
Spite ordered a company of vaulters, runners and side-goers
to the bushes behind Biggy. They moved to their
places noiselessly, and awaited the order to assault. It
came at last.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 134.&mdash;&quot;Wrapped up as Tightly as a Captive Grasshopper Swathed by a Big Garden Spider.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Charge!" shouted Spite. Stridulans at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
moment struck the long roll on his drum, and the Pixies
rushed in upon Biggy. The poor fellow was so frightened
that he made a great leap forward. The Pixies who
had fallen upon him were scattered in all directions,
but, alas for Slymousie, he alighted within one of Tegenaria's
thick snares.<a name="FNanchor_BI_61" id="FNanchor_BI_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> Immediately the Tubeweavers
closed upon him with their blankets, as Spanish bull
fighters assail a wild bull. They blindfolded his eyes,
covered his nostrils, and veiled his face, until they were
wrapped up as tightly as a captive grasshopper swathed
by a big garden spider. Theridion and his Lineweavers
followed this attack, and flung their swathing bands
around Biggy's limbs. The poor fellow, in spite of his
struggles, was soon wrapped up like a mummy, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
last lay still and submitted
to his doom. Spite rigged
block and tackle and windlass,
such as had been used
to hoist Twist; then he fastened
ropes to Biggy's tail,
and bade the Pixies pull
away. Soon the unfortunate
young Slymousie was
raised aloft and hung by his
tail with his nose upon the
ground.<a name="FNanchor_BJ_62" id="FNanchor_BJ_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> His foes surrounded
him, pinched him,
laughed, jeered, shot at him,
until death came to relieve
him of his tormentors. Thus
the second of Corporal
Policy's grand allies came
to grief.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;"><a name="Fig_135" id="Fig_135"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 135.&mdash;Slymousie Hung up by the Tail.</span>
</div>

<p>But the Pixies were not
left to enjoy their triumph
long. A runner ran into
the circle and hurried to
the chief's side. "What's
in the wind now?" asked
Spite.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said the runner,
who was quite blowed
and caught at his breath
between the words, "there's
the&mdash;mischief&mdash;to pay&mdash;down
at&mdash;the lake. The
navy is all in&mdash;commotion. The Natties have got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
help of Scaly the Fish, and have broken loose upon our
Stygies with a vengeance. Scaly has already stove in
two of our ships and a half dozen boats. She is like to
sink the whole navy if we can't stop her somehow. The
Admiral has sent for you."</p>

<p>Spite was as near being overcome by this news as was
possible for him, but he soon recovered. "Here, Pixies!"
he shouted, "down to the beach, every one of you. This
game will keep till you come back,&mdash;if you ever do get
back!" he added in an undertone a remark that
showed pretty clearly that he thought there was serious
work before them.</p>

<p>Matters did indeed have an ugly look when Spite
reached the shore. The wrecks of two ships and several
boats were floating in the water, with Stygians
clinging to them. Boats were pushing out from the
remaining ships bent on leaving them and seeking safety
on land. Two other vessels were standing out to sea
with all sails set, and the flagship Styx, followed closely
by the Goodtime, was slowly making for the shore.
Spite took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>"But what do the Natties mean?" he asked. "They
seem quite as much taken by surprise as our fellows.
Saving a brace of boats yonder, there is not a Brownie
ship under sail. Ah! there they go, now! See those
lights on the Emma? That's the signal to make sail.
And there goes the signal 'to quarters.' Oho! we'll
have our hands full now. But I don't see through
it. Surely, Scaly the Fish isn't operating on her own
hook!"</p>

<p>The reader will understand Spite's perplexity. Most
of the Brownies were indeed taken by surprise. MacWhirlie
had not even told Bruce and Rodney of Corporal
Policy's plot. He had looked upon it simply as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
one of the madcap undertakings which his troopers were
always ready for, and in which he liked to please them
when he could do so. But that it would have any
serious results never entered his mind. With the exception,
therefore, of the volunteers engaged in the expedition,
few were ready for action. But when the vigorous
and successful raid of Scaly was seen by the clear
light of the moon, the Brownies were all astir on
lake and shore. The big davids were double
manned. The ships made sail and prepared for action.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_136.jpg" width="400" height="339"
alt="Fig. 136.&mdash;Wolf Strangle Leaps Upon Scaly&#39;s Back."
title="Fig. 136.&mdash;Wolf Strangle Leaps Upon Scaly&#39;s Back." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 136.&mdash;Wolf Strangle Leaps Upon Scaly&#39;s Back.</span>
</div>

<p>At this point Scaly turned her attention on the Pixie
ships Styx and Goodtime. Mindful of the wishes of her
friend Policy, she resolved to carry these vessels into the
inlet as a present to the Brownies and as trophies of her
prowess. She therefore darted between the shore and
the ships, stopped the vessels' motion by running
athwart their bows, then placing her head first against
one, and next the other, pushed them by alternate shoves
toward the mouth of the inlet, out of which the Natties
were slowly sailing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Scaly was in high good humor, and made the lake
behind her boil under the frisky strokes of her tail as
she urged the Stygian barks forward. The Pixies were
in despair. The Brownies from the shore of the lake
and the decks of their ships sent up ringing cheers.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden turn in affairs. The master of
the Goodtime, Wolf Strangle, was not a person to give
up his ship without a struggle. He was a strong, active
Pixie, a vigorous swimmer, fierce and brave. He made
a desperate resolution: He would grapple with Scaly the
Fish single-handed! He laid aside his sword, threw off
his uniform coat and hat, and mounted the railing at the
stern of the ship. The sailors gathered around him and
waited silently to see what was his purpose. They
would never have guessed the truth but they knew
their captain and were looking for something gallant
and startling in which they expected to take part. This
is what they saw:</p>

<p>Scaly had just given the Styx a vigorous shove, and
turned to do the same service to the Goodtime. She
scarcely noticed the dark form of Strangle poised upon
the railing, but thrust her nose under the stern of the
ship, played her fins and tail, and sent the vessel
merrily ahead. At this moment Strangle leaped fairly
upon her back, seized her with his claws on the forward
side of the dorsal fin, and sunk his fangs again and
again into the fish's flesh.</p>

<p>Scaly wheeled to one side, leaped out of the water,
and dived deep into the lake. Her whole frame was
quivering with the pain and shock of the sudden assault.
The Stygians on the two ships crowded the rails and
ladders, and gazed eagerly toward the spot where they
had seen the two sink out of sight. They had great
confidence in Commander Strangle, but they feared that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
famous waterman as he was, he would be worsted in this
combat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig_137.jpg" width="500" height="380"
alt="Fig. 137.&mdash;How a Spider Captured a Fish."
title="Fig. 137.&mdash;How a Spider Captured a Fish." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 137.&mdash;How a Spider Captured a Fish.</span>
</div>

<p>"He will be drowned!" cried one.</p>

<p>"He dives like a duck," said another, "and will come
up all right."</p>

<p>"No; it was madness to grapple with a fish many
times his size, and in her own element," said a third.</p>

<p>Now the voice of Admiral Quench was heard ordering
first all hands to quarters, and then to tack ship. The
Stygies ran to their posts,
the topmen flew aloft, and
in a few moments both
ships were turned about,
and under full sail from
the inlet. Quench had taken advantage of the diversion
to put all the distance possible between himself and
the Natties.</p>

<p>Before this movement was finished Scaly had emerged
from the water. The black form of Strangle still clung
to her back! The poor fish made the most frantic efforts
to shake off her enemy, who held on as with a death
grip. Scaly plunged under the Styx and tried to scrape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
off the Pixie against the keel. Strangle swung his body
over upon the fish's side but never relaxed his merciless
grasp. Frantic with pain and terror, Scaly swam round
and round in circles, plunged into the water again and
again, and finally, nearly worn out, dragged herself toward
the shore, and ran her head under the grass.
Strangle held on to her body with his fangs, laid hold
with his claws upon the grass stalks above him, and
drawing himself up with his utmost power, had well
nigh succeeded in landing his huge prey ere Spite and
his friends reached the spot.<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> In a few moments more
the unfortunate Scaly was drawn up upon the green
bank, where she was at once assailed by a brood of voracious
Pixies in the same manner as her unhappy ally
Twist the Serpent. Strangle quietly shook the water
from his hair, and perched upon a cliff, together with
Spite and other officers, to watch the turn of events.
The fate of Scaly had made a great change in the condition
of the two fleets.</p>

<p>The Stygians had been much scattered, but were beginning
to rally. Their boats put back to the abandoned
ships, carrying with them many of the sailors who had
been picked up from the wrecks. The loss of the Stygians
was two ships, several boats and a few drowned
sailors. But the victory over Scaly, and the moral
effect upon the navy, was counted a fair offset to this
loss, and on the whole the Pixies were mightily satisfied
with the night's work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Natties had at once taken in
sail, and cast anchor. Some damage had been wrought
upon their enemies by the expedition of Twist, Slymousie
and Scaly; but the defeat and capture of these mammoth
adversaries, under circumstances that showed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
such advantage the Pixies' skill and power, well nigh
demoralized the Brownies. Thrice that night had their
enemies wrested victory from the jaws of defeat, and
had triumphantly annihilated the Grand Alliance of
Corporal Policy. While the Pixies were highly elated,
the Brownies were dispirited, cowed, well nigh in despair.
But, courage, good fairies! The Hebrews had
a proverb&mdash;"When the tale of bricks is doubled, then
comes Moses!"</p>

<p>"The darkest hour is just before the dawn."</p>

<p class="chapname">HOME AGAIN.</p>


<p>Sightwell, the lookout on the Emma, had observed,
during the late stirring events, a suspicious-looking craft
hovering on the outer line of the Stygian fleet. It was
a yacht, apparently one of the privateers or smugglers
that infested the lake. When first sighted it was hugging
the shore, the side opposite the Pixie camp, as
though planning a raid upon the Brownies encamped
on that side of the inlet. When the Stygies had been
scattered by Scaly's first onset, this yacht pushed boldly
out from shore, and headed directly for the inlet, as
though she would come to the rescue of her friends. In
the excitement of the closing incidents in Scaly's career,
Sightwell had quite forgotten the stranger; but as the
Emma came to anchor, he sighted her once more. She
was bearing down upon the inlet under full sail.</p>

<p>"Sail ho!" cried the lookout.</p>

<p>"Where away?" called Ask the mate.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead, and bearing straight down upon us."</p>

<p>"What do you make her out?"</p>

<p>"A yacht,&mdash;a smuggler, I judge. And&mdash;yes, there
are two boats pulling along close under her sides!"</p>

<p>"That looks suspicious," said Ask. "Call the Commodore."</p>

<p>Just as Rodney arrived on deck Sightwell called from
the fore topmast cross-trees: "Our boats are about to
make an attack,&mdash;I mean the boats that first went out
with Scaly and afterward turned back shoreward. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
pull up cautiously to the strangers. The two boats
from the yacht dash away to meet them. They are
about to grapple. Hah! No! what can that mean?
The men in the boats rise and swing their hats. The
yachtsmen are hanging in the rigging swinging kerchiefs,
scarfs, bonnets and swords; I can see the flutter of one
and the flash of the other in the moonlight. Hark!
they are cheering each other!"</p>

<p>It was so, indeed. Over the shimmering surface of
the lake rolled a volume of sound such as never before
went up from so small a company in all the history of
Brownieland.</p>

<p>By this time every soul on shipboard who could get
aloft, or find place at the railings, was gazing across the
water and wondering at this strange occurrence. No
one could solve the mystery. Meanwhile the lookout
continued his report: "The whole scene is now fully in
view. One of the Brownie boats is pulling for the shore
with might and main; the other has left the yacht
and is making straight for the Emma. The oars flash
in the moonlight, and are played so rapidly that the wake
of the boat is an almost unbroken line of gleaming gold.
The Kind, Commander Takeheed, lies directly in the
boat's course, and as the crew pass under the ship's bows
they pause a moment,&mdash;only a moment&mdash;and then on
again as though making a final spurt at a rowing race.</p>

<p>"But what is this? The whole ship's crew has surely
gone mad! Cheer on cheer, wild, loud, uttering the
very madness of joy, goes up from the Kind's crew, till
the welkin rings. See! the flag is being dipped. The
sailors are running over the rigging carrying with them
lanterns which they hang upon every available spot. The
vessel is a blaze of light! They are manning the yards!
And still the cheers rise up and roll over the lake with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
unabated energy. Ah! they have caught the contagion
on the shore, which the first boat has already reached.
A line of lights follows from the landing to the headquarters
tent, springing up at once behind the running
boatmen, until every tent, bush and tree-top is gleaming
with lanterns and torches. The fort is all ablaze. And
such cheers! The camp is wild with joy over some
great event."</p>

<p>"What can it be?"</p>

<p>"Governor Wille has come!" cried an enthusiastic
Natty.</p>

<p>Maybe! But we shall know in a moment. Rodney
and his brave tars are well nigh beside themselves with
excitement and wonder as the boat on which every eye
is now centred, dashes alongside. A brawny sailor is at
the bow, necktie thrown off, shirt wide open, hatless,
and nearly breathless with excitement. Hist! the deck
is silent as death, and every ear stoops for the message.</p>

<p>"The lost Nurses are found! Faith&mdash;Sophia&mdash;they're
on yonder yacht! Pipe, True, Blythe&mdash;they're all there&mdash;all
safe!"</p>

<p>Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!</p>

<p>Never were such echoes wakened from the green
bosom of Hillside and the blue face of Lake Katrine,
as those which answered back the ringing shout. The
tidings flew from ship to ship; land and lake were soon
gleaming with countless lights, and the very leaves above
them shook with the sound of cheers and singing till the
gathering dew dropped down from their quivering sides.</p>

<p>And Rodney? We draw a veil upon his emotion as
the tidings came to him. Equally, we drop the curtain
upon the scene which followed, when the Fringe&mdash;for it
was Raft's yacht, the same that bore the Nurses away
into captivity,&mdash;drew up to the side of the Emma, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Rodney sprung upon her deck and clasped his darling
Faith in his arms. Presently the yacht landed its precious
cargo at the foot of Cape Home, where all the
return party were publicly welcomed. Then the Nurses
were led away to their own tent and the embrace of their
dear companions Agatha and Grace.</p>

<p>Faith and Sophia safe in the midst of the Brownie
camp once more! Surely the dayspring has come at last!</p>

<p>All this time Spite the Spy stood upon the cliff surrounded
by his staff, all of them champing, fretting,
cursing, wondering, guessing, well nigh distracted in
their perplexity over these strange doings. The whole
thing was so mysterious, the burst of joy on the part of
the Brownies so sudden and extreme, that awe fell upon
the Pixie host. Vague presentiments of coming evil
hung upon many hearts. The troops lay down solitary
and silent to sleep.<a name="FNanchor_BL_64" id="FNanchor_BL_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_64" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a></p>

<p>Spite sat upon the cliff alone, looking at the moonlight
upon the water, gazing across the mouth of the inlet
into the illuminated camp of the Brownies, venting his
hatred and disappointment in oaths, and weaving in his
busy brain some plot by which to find out ere he retired
the cause of his enemies' joy. He had already sent out
scouts to prowl along the outer entrenchments of Fort
Home, which divided the Brownie tents on the south
side of the stream from his own. As he sat there,
awaiting their return, he queried again and again,
"What can it be?" Ah, Spite, you shall find out ere
long, and it will be the last tidings that your ears shall
ever hear!</p>

<p>We go back now to take up the story of the party
upon Ellen's Isle, and trace it to this happy ending.
We left the little camp settled into happy sleep after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the rescue of Faith and Sophia from Arachne Hall.
The morning broke calm and bright, early driving away
the mists that hung over the island. The first thought
of all turned upon escape. It seemed beyond endurance
to be shut up on that little spot, so near their friends,
with such glorious news in their keeping. Faith in particular
found it hard to restrain her feelings. She was
indeed free, and her lover was by her side; but how
could she wait for the hour when the load of grief should
be rolled from her father's heart?</p>

<p>But stubborn facts shut the party in. One boat,
which had nearly swamped under the load that it had
carried to the island, was all that they could command.
And now there were three others, Pipe and the two
Nurses, to be cared for. The sailors asked to be left to
shift for themselves, while the officers, and as many as
could be stowed away safely, should make the best of
their way to land. No! that would be selfish and
couldn't be thought of. Besides, there was the risk!
The Stygies were closely guarding the inlet; and the
Pixie camp at Big Cave lay between them and the army.
All over the lake and along shore the pirate crafts,
smugglers and yachts were plying. These facts made
departure in an open boat too great a risk, especially
with such precious passengers to look after. By themselves,
no adventure would have been too daring for the
humor of the wrecked Brownies, but with Faith and
Sophia in their company they felt doubly engaged to
caution. Then there was that mysterious boat's crew
from the Doubt. The least imprudence might reveal
to them the presence of the Brownie party, and call
down upon the little band the whole Stygian fleet. It
was a perplexing position, and they must be wise and
patient and make the best of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>"First of all," said Pipe, who now took command,
"we must try to rig up another boat. Now, my hearties,
out with your hatchets and ropes and get to work!"</p>

<p>The sailors could turn their hands to every sort of
handicraft, and some of them were quite skillful mechanics.
Fortunately, Square, the ship's carpenter of
one of the sunken vessels, was among the number picked
up by Coxswain Help, and to him the boat building was
entrusted. First the frame was made ready. A hickory
twig was laid upon the ground, and bent at both ends.
This formed the keel. Both ends of two similar twigs
were fastened to each end of the keel piece, and bent
outward to form the gunwale. These pieces were held in
position by braces until the ribs were set, which were
shorter twigs bent around the frame and fastened to the
keel piece beneath, and to the gunwale on either side.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Square, when this work was done,
"now for the covering. We must find a birch tree for
that, and strip the bark from some of the branches."</p>

<p>The Natties soon came back from the woods bringing
enough white birch bark to cover a man-of-war. The
framework was entirely covered with this, the pieces
being lapped far over one another, so as to make the
joints as water-tight as possible.</p>

<p>"Now," said Chips, as the sailors call the carpenter,
"if we had a little oakum to caulk these seams we should
be all right."</p>

<p>"We can fix that for you," answered one of the sailors.
"Here is a grass whose fibres, if well scraped, will give
us quite a good substitute for tow. As for tar, we can
get on very well with the gum on yonder pine tree."</p>

<p>"A good thought," said Square, "and I will leave
you to carry it out, while I get ready the thwarts and
bottom boards."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>The thwarts were simply undressed twigs laid close
together after the fashion of a rustic seat, and fastened
against the ribs, and the bottom board was built in the
same way. The whole affair had a rustic appearance,
when it was finished, but it promised to be serviceable,
and that was the main matter. When the woodwork
was done the boat was turned keel up, and the caulking
began. The fibres of grass were torn and drawn into
fine threads, and these made passable oakum, which was
thrust into the seams between the layers of bark until
they were thoroughly stopped. Now rollers were put
under the keel, ropes were fastened to the stern, and by
pushing and pulling the boat was safely launched upon
the lake. It floated well, and was water-tight. The
building of the boat took the whole of that day and
part of the following, and all hands were vastly pleased
at the results. They now had the means to escape
from the island whenever the way opened.</p>

<p>After dinner, whilst Square wrought upon the boat,
and Pipe and Blythe guarded the camp, True and
Clearview, at the head of a small party, sallied forth to
explore. They set out for the head of the island, that
is, the end toward the inlet, marching as stealthily as an
Indian war party. They were chiefly concerned to find
out what the boat's crew from the Stygian ship Doubt
had to do upon Ellen's Isle, and whether there seemed
any prospect that they would pass over to the opposite
end, and thus imperil the Brownies. They had well
nigh skirted the entire south shore before they observed
any signs of the Pixies.</p>

<p>"What is that?" cried Sailor Filip, pointing to a
small conical mound just beyond the path, built of dry
grass stalks and small twigs. Thereupon he ran up to
it and exclaimed: "It is a tom-tit's nest, built flat upon
the ground!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who ever heard the like?" shouted a companion;
and thereat the Brownies began to guy the discoverer,
and ran into the thicket to get a closer view.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" they exclaimed as they got quite near,
"it truly is a bird's nest of some sort. But what a
weenie one! And what bird could have built it?"</p>

<p>"Come, let us explore it!" said a little Brownie
who by a well-known rule of contrariness was called
Jumbo. So saying, he began clambering up the sides.</p>

<p>"Good for Jumbo!" his comrades cried, and followed
close at his heels. It was easy climbing, and the
Brownies having quickly reached the top were amazed
to find no bottom to the nest! They looked down
into a deep crater that pierced the ground below the
surface, and led into depths hidden in darkness.</p>

<p>"I'm bound to solve this mystery!" said Jumbo.
"Who'll go with me into the hole?" He swung over
the edge, and his comrades were about following, when
they were stopped by a sharp cry from Jumbo: "Look
out there!"</p>

<p>"Look in, you mean," said Filip. And they all
looked into the burrow. They saw a row of gleaming
eyes that sparkled like jewels as they slowly moved upward
into the light. Then came into view a claw; then
another, and another, and next the brown head of a great
Pixie!</p>

<p>"Whew!" cried Jumbo. "Somersault all, and out
of this, instanter!" He swung himself back over the
outer edge of the nest and rattled down the rugged side
in such haste that he tumbled in a little heap upon the
grass, and was presently buried under the sprawling
limbs of his comrades. When the Brownies got to their
feet they saw a huge ground Pixie of the clan Lycosa,
glaring at them over the edge of the nest, and plainly
getting ready to spring down upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cut and run, lads!" shouted Jumbo, and away the
squad scurried out of the thicket, leaving Lycosa
perched upon the crest of her nest-like tower. When
they told their story to Captain Clearview, he bade two
of the Natties remain in the path, and keep watch upon
the nest-building Pixie lest she might sally forth and
attack the party on flank or rear. Then he bade the
squad move on. They had gone but a short march when
the Captain called a halt.</p>

</div>

<p>"See," he said, pointing toward the lake, "yonder is
the boat! It is tied to the shore, without any attempt
at concealment. Plainly, the crew has no suspicion of
our presence here. Their camp can't be far away."
The scouting party was halted, and Clearview and True
stole through the young willows that fringed the shore.</p>

<p>"Hist! there they are!" whispered True, who had
caught the sound of voices. "Do you see them?"</p>

<p>"No, but they are just beyond this fallen sapling.
Here, we can climb upon the trunk and overlook the
bivouac safely."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>
<p>In a small open space, near the point where the boat
lay, the camp had been pitched. A large tent with a
tubular entrance had been built over the hole made by
the uplifted root of an overthrown oak. Another tent
was pitched above this on a platform made of earth
which had adhered to the projecting roots; and a third
was woven over the top of a clump of weeds, its tubular
entrance or hall running straight down to the ground.
A bridge of silken ropes stretched from the camp to the
tops of the willows that skirted the shore, and from the
tents to the edge of the water. It was a snug and
pretty retreat.<a name="FNanchor_BN_66" id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a></p>

<p>True and Clearview climbed into the branches of the
fallen tree, crept along the trunk, and found themselves
near enough to overlook the entire camp and overhear
the conversation which had first attracted their attention.
They were themselves hidden among the leaves.
A sentinel stood in the circular doorway of the tent
which occupied the hole below the roots. Just beyond,
two Pixie officers walked to and fro, talking loudly and
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" whispered True.</p>

<p>"Yes; that fellow in black is Halfway the son of
Hide; he is one of the principal Stygian chiefs. The
one in the brown uniform with broad whitish band is
Agalena Ringster; he is one of the Tubeweaving
Pixies, a tricky fellow and captain of the marines."</p>

<p>"Softly," said True, as the Pixies, having reached the
limit of their promenade, turned and walked toward the
tent. "We shall find out now what they talk about."</p>

<p>"You are sure you understand your father aright?"
asked Ringster.</p>

<p>"Quite; he said that the cave was at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Aranea Isle&mdash;head, I think it was; it's the only point
about which I feel uncertain. I am positive of all the
rest."</p>

<p>"But," said Ringster, "there is no such cave, for we
have explored every inch of ground thoroughly. Pity
the old man was cut off so suddenly! But we must act
on your uncertainty, and try the foot of the island.
There's nothing else for it; you can't go to Spite about
this matter; that would spoil all."</p>

<p>"There's the trouble. We have wasted too much time
already. Our absence will be noticed. We can't do
much to-day, and&mdash;but will to-morrow be clear?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Look at my marines yonder. Do you see them
putting up a new tent?" Ringster pointed to the tall
grass near the willows, over which a fresh silken canvas
was being rapidly spread. "They never do that in
threatening weather. You can rely upon it more certainly
than our fine Governor does upon his Old Probabilities."<a name="FNanchor_BO_67" id="FNanchor_BO_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a></p>

<p>"But if we fail to discover anything on the foot of
the island?" asked Halfway. "Can we take the time
to go over the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the voices of the officers grew indistinct, as they
had turned upon their course and gone to the far end of
the enclosure. They were soon within ear-shot again,
but the thread of conversation had been lost.</p>

<p>"But where is he?" asked Ringster. "If our search
fails we must fall back upon him. He was your father's
friend, and will serve you faithfully. Where does he
keep his yacht?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But&mdash;I declare! I had quite forgotten
it! He was to meet father here to-day!"</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Ringster; "that is the best news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
yet. It was stupid enough in you not to remember it
before. That makes matters plain. We may wait here
until he comes, and save ourselves all trouble. But
where will he land?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that," responded Halfway. "If I am
right as to the location of the cave, he would touch here,
of course. If not&mdash;" Here the Pixies entered one of
their tents and the conversation was wholly lost.</p>

<p>"We have heard enough," whispered True. "Let
us away!" Noiselessly as they had approached, the
Brownie spies stole back again to their friends, and
reported their discoveries.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it all?" asked Help.</p>

<p>True answered: "That scamp Halfway is after the
cave in which Faith and Sophia were concealed. Don't
you remember that they told us of Hide's plans? The
old rogue had been laying some scheme to circumvent
Spite, and was cut off before he had finished it, or fully
revealed it to his hopeful son."</p>

<p>"And the last part of the conversation&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Refers to Raft, beyond a doubt," answered Clearview.
"Now the question is, what shall we do? These
Pixies will be down upon our camp to-morrow at the
furthest. We must get out of the island, at least out
of our present quarters, very soon, unless, indeed, we
agree to stand and fight it out."</p>

<p>"Well," said Help, "I have thought of a plan that
will save us from our greatest danger. I was sorely
tempted to put it into execution, while you were away.
Look there," pointing to the Pixie boat. "If that were
out of the problem we could solve it a good deal more
readily. What I fear most is that these Doubtmen, at
the first alarm, may pull off to the fleet, and bring such
a force against us as will overwhelm us. If they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
here alone with us we might have a fair standup fight,
or a struggle of plot and counterplot, and come off well
enough. Can't we get that boat adrift? It is not
guarded; we can steal along the shore, loosen the cable
and let her drift off on the current. I will volunteer for
the service."</p>

<p>The party greeted this plan with approbation, and it
was immediately carried out. Help and two of the
sailors crept along the shore, under the drooping boughs
of the willows, and reached the boat safely. Silently
and quickly they slipped the cable by which she was
moored to the bank, and placing their spears against the
bow, gave a vigorous push. The current was strong at
this point, sweeping from the inlet along the head of the
island toward the foot, and so out into the lake. In a
few moments the boat had drifted out of sight beyond
the willows, and was on its way to the outlet.</p>

<p>It had immediately floated away beyond recovery, before
Halfway, who had mounted the bridge to look out for
Raft, saw that the boat was gone, and raised the alarm.
He stormed, swore, questioned, threatened. In the meantime
Ringster had quietly ascended one of the tallest
bushes, and was carefully surveying the lake.</p>

<p>"I see her!" he cried, pointing toward the outlet.
"Yonder she drifts, far beyond the foot of the island,
and out of reach. The current is so strong here that
she has pulled up the stake or slipped her painter, and
the current has carried her away. It's bad business for
us, but storming won't mend matters. We must make
the best of it and quietly wait for Raft. If he fails us,
we must set signals for some of our own ships." So
saying he got down from his perch and entered his tent,
an example which the rest were not slow to follow.</p>

<p>The Brownies set their faces homeward well satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
with the results of the scout, and anxious to reach camp
before sunset. But their adventures were not ended.
As the party stealthily threaded the shore in Indian file,
Clearview, who was in the lead, suddenly halted and
threw up a hand in token of silence.</p>

<p>"Hist&mdash;softly! See there!"</p>

<p>He pointed to a gaily uniformed water Pixie stretched
upon the ground a little beyond them, sound asleep.
The Brownie sailors lifted their spears, and were about
to hurl them at the prostrate form.</p>

<p>"Hold!" said True in an undertone, "we must capture
this fellow. He may be Raft himself. It is his
uniform, at least; and if it be he, no Brownie hand
must harm him save in lawful battle. Let us move
softly, and at the signal surround and capture him." It
was done as ordered, and the sleeping waterman awoke
to find himself in the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>"Are you Raft Dolomede?" asked True.</p>

<p>"Well, what then, Sir?" answered the Pixie defiantly.</p>

<p>"Then your life shall be spared for a kindness done
in an hour of great need to those whom we love."</p>

<p>The captive cast a keen, inquiring glance into True's
face; then answered coolly, "Humph! that's a temptation
to sail under false colors that most of my kin would
thank'ee for. But I don't take kindly to lying, and
don't ask for life at Brownie hands. Do your worst&mdash;and
as soon as you please. My name's not Raft."</p>

<p>Again the Brownie spears were poised, and again True
interfered to save the captive. "Beat those bushes
along the shore," he cried; "we shall carry our prisoner
to camp." Presently the sailors returned and reported
that they had found a yacht at anchor under the willows
just beyond.</p>

<p>"Any name on her?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye; 'The Fringe' is worked in white silk upon
one of the sails."</p>

<p>True turned to his captive and asked, "Are you the
captain of that yacht?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir," was the stout answer, "the Captain's looking
for some messmates down yonder at the foot of the
island."</p>

<p>True started. "Haste! Mark the spot where the
yacht lies. Bring on the prisoner&mdash;away, away!"</p>

<p>The Brownie camp was soon reached. Square and
his squad left their boat-building to stare at the new
arrival, and overwhelmed their friends with wondering
questions. Faith and Sophia left their tent to learn the
cause of the commotion. The crowd of sailors around
the scouts and their prisoner fell back, bringing the
Pixie into full view. Sophia uttered a cry and ran forward.</p>

<p>"Do not harm him, True," she exclaimed, "this is
Raft! Save him; he is the only one who showed us
kindness in our captivity."</p>

<p>Raft, for it was indeed he, cast down his eyes and said
nothing. True looked in amazement upon him, and
asked half angrily: "What reason, even according to
Pixie policy, could you have had for telling us such
lies?"</p>

<p>Raft was silent. In sooth, he could hardly have
answered the question. Perhaps he had felt, more keenly
than he cared to show, Sophia's refusal to marry him;
perhaps he was moved by ideas of fidelity to his own
party; perhaps he was simply stubborn and defiant;
perhaps he was really ashamed, after the manner of
some human beings, to confess and talk about anything
so far out of his common life as a good deed. At all
events, he refused to speak to any one, even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Nurses. He was securely bound and carefully guarded
throughout the night.</p>

<p>Next morning Pipe called a council, and announced a
plan of escape. "We have, or shall have soon," said
he, "two boats and Raft's yacht. We could get off
quite well in the boats; but the risks of meeting some
of the Pixie craft would be considerable. We can
avoid that by taking out the Fringe with us, and pulling
our boats close alongside of her. The Stygies will not
suspect anything wrong with a craft they know so well.
We can get quite near the fleet without challenge, and
trust to luck to run the gauntlet of the ships afterwards."</p>

<p>The plan was accepted at once and it was agreed to
attempt the escape that evening, when the moon would
give enough light to sail by, but not too much to allow
close observation. There were two difficulties in the
way, Raft and the Doubtmen. The first was happily
disposed of. Pipe approached the prisoner in his hearty
sailor fashion. He saw at a glance that the smuggler
was in a better humor than on the evening before.</p>

<p>"Mornin', shipmate," said Pipe. "We're going to
leave these quarters this evening, and take a little cruise
toward the inlet. We have need of your craft for a
convoy and want to make matters as easy for you as
possible. We give you your choice; stay here tied to
that tree until your friends at the head of the island
can find and release you, or go with us on the Fringe.
If you choose the first, you must lose your yacht; if the
second, we promise you that when we are safe alongside
a Nattie ship, or in the Brownie camp, you shall sail off
unmolested. What say you?"</p>

<p>Raft twisted himself into a more comfortable position,
pulled upon the cords that bound him, and answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
"Well, Bow'sn, I might as well say thank'ee at once. I
choose number two. It's not a pretty thing for a free
rover like me to be lashed up here like a sailor on a
man-o'-war seized up for a flogging. An' d'ye think I'd
trust those fellows on the Point to cut these cables and
set me free? If it suited their own interests they might;
otherwise Raft might go to Pluto for all them. As to
giving up the Fringe"&mdash;here a tear started into the
smuggler's eye, "not if I can help it, Bow'sn! Why,
I love that pretty thing more'n my life. She's as dear
to me as your daughter is to you. Aye, aye, Sir! I'll
save the Fringe, bless her pretty timbers! So heave
ahead, as soon as you're a mind to. One cruise with a
Brownie skipper won't hurt, I reckon. 'Specially as a
fellow can't help it."</p>

<p>That matter being arranged, the boat-building was
hurried up, and as the skiff was nearly finished, it was
launched as already described. Camp was then broken,
and the whole party embarked in the boats and pulled
around the island, keeping close under the shadow of
the overhanging willows, to the point where the Fringe
lay. Faith and Sophia were placed aboard the yacht,
and Raft, still bound, was kept under guard in one of
the boats.</p>

<p>"Now, my hearties," said Pipe, as the Brownies
landed, "we may as well get ready for some rough
work. This is my plan. We are to go into ambush,
just beyond there. I am satisfied that the Pixies will
take this path to the foot of the island. The other side
is well nigh a jungle, while here is an open way. You
are to wait under cover until Halfway and his party
appear. Then at the signal you are to open on them
with spears, and rush upon them with swords, making
all the noise you can. I count, pretty confidently, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
they will be thrown into confusion, and will make
straight back to their camp and fortify themselves. If
they do so, we are all right and can sail away at our
leisure. If they show fight, we must stand up to them
like men and do our best."</p>

<p>The ambush was soon arranged. A scout who had
been sent forward to the Point, was seen swinging along
under the bushes, stooping as he ran, and moving noiselessly.
He reported that the Pixies were about leaving
camp, and, as had been conjectured, by the path on that
side. The word was passed along, and all sank into
silence as Halfway and his command strode on carelessly
talking and laughing. When they reached the
fatal spot, the Boatswain's whistle rose shrill and loud
from the bushes above the path. It was the signal of
attack.</p>

<p>"Faith, Sophia and Rescue!"</p>

<p>The Brownies shouted this battle cry, which Pipe had
given them, as though the voice and strength of ten
were in every throat. At the same instant a volley of
spears rained down upon the astounded Stygians, and,
ere they could recover from their surprise, the Natties
were upon them with swift sabre strokes.</p>

<p>Pipe had reckoned truly. The surprise was so complete,
the attack so vigorous, the names of the Nurses,
whom the Pixies were seeking, had such a startling
effect as they were shouted and echoed on every side,
and the Pixies were so utterly unprepared for defence,
that they turned at once, and fled in disorder to their
camp, where they began throwing up entrenchments.
Three of their number were left dead upon the ground,
one of whom was their leader, Halfway, who fell pierced
through and through by spears which True and Clearview
had hurled at him with sure aim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my lads," said Pipe, putting up his sword, "we
may as well take matters comfortably until sundown.
Then, up anchor, and away home!"</p>

<p>A ringing cheer was the response. Sentinels were
stationed, a scout sent out to watch the Pixie camp, and
the party quietly rested until evening. When the moon
arose above the lake, the anchor of the Fringe was raised,
the boats were manned, and the little fleet swung loose
from the island. Both wind and current were against
them at first, and little progress was made. But Raft,
who had been released on parole and was aboard his
beloved Fringe, aided heartily in navigating the yacht,
while the boats kept close under her sides. Gradually
the party approached the inlet, and arrived unchallenged
within the lines of the Stygian fleet just as Scaly began
her attack. That event somewhat unsettled the plans
of our little squadron, but Pipe soon found that it might
work to their advantage. He crowded on all sail, and
made straight for the Emma, with what results the
reader already knows.</p>

<p>The Brownies dealt with Raft as they had promised,
and when the island party had safely landed on the
Emma, the smuggler was allowed to sail away with the
Fringe, untouched. He made directly for Ellen's Isle,
took aboard the Pixies there, secured the body of Halfway,
and after delivering the living and dead aboard
the Doubt, ran his yacht under the cliff whereon we last
saw Spite the Spy seated, waiting, in solitude, tidings from
his scouts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">ENSIGN LAWE'S MISSION.</p>


<p>Shortly after the renowned adventure with the Stygian
Ram, Ensign Lawe had been sent upon a mission to
Governor Wille. He had been told to spare no effort
to arouse the Governor from his indifference to Brownie
perils and sufferings, and bring him to their help.
"Take all the time you need," added Bruce, "and don't
let us see your face until you can bring from Wille a
fixed decision, Yea or Nay."</p>

<p>These were hard instructions; but the Ensign was
used to facing difficulties, and overcoming them, too.
He therefore rode away, with a few trusty troopers,
determined to succeed if success were possible. Arrived
at the Mansion he found preparations afoot for a grand
company in honor of the distinguished Major-General
Fleisch. Many people had been invited, and when
evening came the house and grounds were thronged.
There were Parson Prettyman and his wife, Senator
Wirepull, the Honorable Mr. Splurge, M.C., Mr.
Shearall the rich banker, Mr. Shortweight the wealthy
merchant, Lawyers Grip and Gab, Drs. Sugarcoat and
Skindeep, Squire Muddle, Mayor Sponge, and Messrs.
Taxem and Robb of the City Council. There were, to
be sure, some most worthy people besides, but the above
seemed to be favorites with Governor Wille, and to them
and the great General Fleisch he showed particular
attentions. There was no end of merrymaking. A band
played beautiful music from a rustic stand in front of
the hall door. Chinese lanterns hung upon trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
shrubbery, and these, with the light of the full moon,
made the grounds look like a scene in fairyland.</p>

<p>Amidst all this splendor and gaiety the Pixies kept
on spreading their tents upon the lawn. Every now
and then, indeed, some of the company would overturn
a tent and send its occupants fleeing into their holes
among the roots. But that is a matter which Pixies
count upon, and therefore they only grumbled and got
to work again. Indeed they were quite proud of the
whole affair.</p>

<p>"Ho! Brother Cito," said Captain Saltus of the
Skirmishers. "Isn't this a grand celebration of our
victory?"</p>

<p>"That is it!" answered Cito; "a regular jubilee. Good
luck to Governor Ville, and confusion to all Brownies!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" growled Heady, "they're a pack of
human fools! And you're little better for thinking that
they care for our victories."</p>

<p>"Let those laugh who win," thought Ensign Lawe,
who was hidden in the rose bush just above the group,
and overheard these remarks. "However, there will be
little chance to forward my mission to-night. The
Governor has given himself up wholly to pleasuring
that big general, and will have a heavy ear for Brownie
complaints and petitions."</p>

<p>He sat on the bush and swung himself to and fro,
and listened to the strains of music, the hum of conversation,
the clatter of plates and goblets, until the small
hours of the night had come. Then he saw Wille and
Dido go off wearily to their bed-chamber, and wondered,
"Shall I disturb them? No! I will wait until they are
refreshed by sleep, and will appeal to them in the
brightness of the new morning."</p>

<p>As the day began to break Ensign Lawe awoke. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
peeped from beneath the leafy canopy under which he had
slept sound and dry. Over the lawn the white tents of
the Pixies were spread far and wide. Squads and companies
of busy workers were rapidly pushing on the

the Promenade under the west window.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this!" cried the Ensign. "Ho!
Brownies, awake! Hi! ponies, up! Shake the dew
off your wings!" He leaped upon his own nag, and
followed by his dragoons, flew across to the Virginia
creeper that ran over the west wall and twined above the
windows of the chamber where Wille and Dido slept.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 140.&mdash;Madam Lacemaker Tries to Capture Ensign Lawe.</span>
</div>

<p>It was the Ensign's hap to alight upon a leaf whereon
a small and rather dainty but vigorous Pixinee, named
Madam Dictyna the Lacemaker, had built a snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
pavilion. Spite had set her as an especial sentinel upon
my lady Dido; and when Lawe and his dragoons made
such a rude entrance upon her domain she was sorely
vexed. Shaking her lace frills and skirts, she ran out
from her tent and threatened the Brownies with high
bluster and rage.</p>

<p>But Lawe would not permit her to be attacked just
then; he had other work to do, to which the Lacemaker's
presence only spurred him forward. The party
left their ponies outside, and crept through the slats of
the closed blind into the room. They mounted the bed-post,
climbed atop of the carved headboard, and began
drumming with their feet and spears upon the solid
walnut.</p>

<p>"Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Tat, tat, tat!"</p>

<p>Neither of the sleepers stirred.</p>

<p>"Louder, lads, louder!" shouted the Ensign.
"Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Tat, tat!"</p>

<p>Still the weary couple slept.</p>

<p>"Stop!" called Lawe. "No use! Late hours&mdash;late
supper&mdash;champagne! We must wait and try something
better. Away!"</p>

<p>As they descended the bed and scampered back to the
window they were greeted by a loud, prolonged nasal
serenade from the unconscious pair.</p>

<p>"Puff! pu-ff-ff!&mdash;oo,&mdash;haw!" breathed Dido quite
gently, indeed, after a fashion which goes with some folk
by the name of "boiling mush."</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;oogh&mdash;ha&mdash;aw&mdash;<i>hogh!</i>" was the answering
snore from the Governor's nose, with a tremendous force
upon the "hogh!" In fact, it came out with such a
sharp explosion, that Wille's head flew forward, and he
awoke.</p>

<p>"Wife," said he sleepily&mdash;"I say, wife!" and here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
gave Dido a little tap under the chin. "Don't snore so
loud, please! Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;really you made a terrible
racket. I thought at first that some one was pounding
the bedstead!"</p>

<p>Dido was quite awake now, and answered indignantly,
"Snore indeed! You'd better talk! Pounding
the bedstead! It's too bad!" And thereupon the little
lady turned over sharply toward the wall, and composed
herself to sleep.</p>

<p>However, the Governor had lost the benefit of Dido's
speech; for ere she had finished he was sound asleep,
and snoring almost as vigorously as before. Meanwhile
the Brownies had returned to their rose-bush retreat
ignorant of the amusing scene for which their little feet
were responsible.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Lawe, "we must succeed. If we
can once get the Governor to see, in the early morning,
while the dew lies upon their tent-tops and reveals them
what a vast camp of our enemies holds our old and
rightful quarters, I am sure that he will clear out the
usurpers at once!"</p>

<p>"Aye; but how shall we bring that about?" said
Corporal Trust.</p>

<p>"We must have help. Come, lads, mount and away!"
answered Lawe.</p>

<p>He led his troopers straight toward the orchard.
Over the tree-tops they flew; on, up, until at last he
halted the party on one of the spreading limbs of Lone
Aspen. There the Ensign dismounted and approaching
the Lone Aspen the first object upon which his eyes fell
was a round, horizontal snare of Uloborus, spread within
the hollow of the trunk, where the great gateway opened
at the foot. His anger was highly inflamed at the sight,
and he forgot his mission in the eager purpose to rout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
this foe lurking at the doorway of his friend, Madam
Breeze. He ran hastily forward and smote the web
with his sword until it fell to the ground. Uloborus,
who was stretched beneath it on a ribbon-like hammock,
tumbled down with the ruins of his orb; and thereat Ensign
Lawe fell upon him with his sword. But the Pixie,
thinking discretion the better part of valor, dodged the
strokes, and shaking himself loose from the fragments
of his late beautiful net, ran away at top of his speed,
and plunged into the thick grass around the roots of the
tree. Lawe did not think well to follow; and his wrath
being somewhat vented, turned again to the errand on
which he had come. He climbed the grass-rope ladder
stretched along the trunk, and having reached the upper
window at the great knot-hole, blew a shrill blast upon
his bugle. The echoes rolled up and down the hollow
trunk.</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!"</p>

<p>The round mellow voice of Madam Breeze answered
the call, and a moment thereafter the merry Elf bobbed
her rubicund face out of the window.</p>

<p>"Hah! who is there? Brownies again, I warrant&mdash;Wheeze!
More forts to smash? Ho, ho, ho! Why,
my sides are aching yet with that last bout. Ho, ho!&mdash;Hoogh!"
It seemed more likely that the good lady's
sides were aching with her hearty laughter.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 141.&mdash;&quot;A Round, Horizontal Snare of Uloborus, Spread Within the Hollow of the Trunk.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Didn't we batter them, though?" she ran on.
"Down went tents! Down went barricades! Down
went fort&mdash;Hoogh!" Here Madam gave one of her
little coughs. "Well, no, not exactly that, neither.
That was too much for us. But no matter! The vile
old den got its deserts anyhow. Ho, ho! Phaugh!
And how's Spite the Spy? Has his breath improved
any? Wheeze&mdash;Dear me! I doubt if he ever scrubs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
his teeth. Think of a pure, sweet Breeze-body like
myself having to wrestle with such as he! Don't ask
me to! No, no! It's too funny, ho, ho!&mdash;Wheeze&mdash;hoogh!
You see my asthma's no better&mdash;Wheeze!"</p>

<p>All this time the Elf had been seated on a broad leaf
swinging like a pendulum, and gazing into the clouds.
She suddenly stopped and looked into the Ensign's face.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she cried, "I&mdash;I&mdash;and so it's not Bruce
this time? The rogue&mdash;the scamp&mdash;the&mdash;ah!&mdash;Wheeze!
How could he dare to deceive me so?&mdash;Hoogh!"</p>

<p>For one minute Madam Breeze sat still, actually for
a whole minute! The fact is, she was just a trifle afraid
of Ensign Lawe, the only one of all the Brownies, by the
way, who ever dashed her high spirits a particle. During
that moment the good Elf looked as sober as she
could then threw her heels up and her head down, and
swung away furiously for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Oho! It's you, is it? Well, things must be serious
when Lawe comes a-gossiping to Madam Breeze. Well,
well! Cheer up, cheer up, Mr. Sobersides!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shall we, inclined to sadness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0q">Strike melancholy's string?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, no! we'll tune to gladness<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">And merrily, merrily sing<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Tra, la!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Elf trilled these words to a sprightly strain, and
wound up with a laugh, a wheeze and a cough. By this
time her touch of seriousness had vanished, and she was
swinging as lustily as ever.</p>

<p>"There now, Mr. Lawe. You see I'm composed and
ready for business. Go on with your story. Bad news?&mdash;of
course! Yes, yes&mdash;hoogh! I know something
about it&mdash;bad! There,&mdash;stand still a minute, can't
you?&mdash;and go on!"</p>

<p>Lawe had stood silent and motionless, all this while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
waiting for Madam Breeze to settle herself. But as he
saw that this was not likely to happen, he began the
story of Brownie disasters, and after many interruptions
reached the matter he had in hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I see it all," said the Elf. "Not another
word&mdash;it is all right. Here, Whirlit, Keener! Put my
ponies Vesper and Vacuum into the chariot&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>The word had scarcely been spoken ere the two pages
returned leading a House Martin and a Meadow Lark,
who were harnessed to a maple leaf mounted upon wheels
of thistledown. The stem of the leaf served as the
tongue of the chariot, and the palm of the leaf was bent
over at the apex and bent up at the base, so as to make
a very pretty fairy coach indeed.</p>

<p>The lark's name was Vesper, the martin's Vacuum,
and Madam Breeze had taken the liberty of nicknaming
them "Vesp" and "Vac."</p>

<p>"Come; in with you!" cried the good Elf, and suddenly
contracting herself into the very smallest compass,
as she was wont at times to do, she bounced into the chariot.
The Ensign followed. Whirlit and Keener mounted
the bird ponies, and waited for the word of command.</p>

<p>"To the cove. Go!" shouted Madam Breeze; and
away the party went over orchard and meadow, over
town, bridge and river. They stopped at the summit
of a hill that stands at the mouth of the cove, whose
brow has been worn by frosts, heats and storms of
centuries, until it stands up a bald cliff. The naked
rock below has a rough likeness to a human face, and
the fringe of bushes underneath gives the idea of a vast
beard. The top of the cliff is covered with trees that
look in the far distance like tufts of frizzly hair upon
the Giantstone's poll. From the midst of these rose
(when these records were made) two pine trees. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
tall trunks were quite bare, their bushy branches interlocked
closely, and thus was left a goodly sized opening,
through which at that time of the year the sun was first
seen of mornings coming down into the valley. The
fairies called this the Gate of the Sun, and it was to
visit four sister Elves who kept this gate that Madam
Breeze had now come. The gate stood wide open, for
the sunshine was already gone through to the town and
hills beyond. In a snug little cave in the limestone
front of the hill, a sort of "mouth" to the Giantstone's
face, the four Elves lived.</p>

<p>Lawe followed as briskly as possible, swung himself
from bough to bough of the overhanging shrubbery,
landed upon a narrow ledge, and found his way to the
mouth of the Cave of the Clouds. Madam Breeze,
now expanded in bodily form to goodly size, had already
entered and was bustling around the place calling for
the sisters.</p>

<p>"Hi! Cirrus! Ho, Stratus! Here, here&mdash;where are
you?&mdash;Wheeze!"</p>

<p>The dead dry leaves whirled around and around as
the merry Elf called, and the echoes answered her voice.</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;e&mdash;oh! Cumulus! Nimbus! Can't you hear?"</p>

<p>The bustling Elf had no cause to be impatient, for
she had scarcely spoken ere four forms slowly rose in
the shadows of the inner cave, and began to move deliberately
toward the light. The first advanced with airy
footstep, shaking about her face a cloud of long curling
locks, almost white. She was dressed in a white robe,
covered with trellis-work patterns, inwrought with thin
silvery streaks. This was Elf Cirrus.</p>

<p>The second sister was a plump, sober-looking Elf,
whose hair was gathered in woolly puffs upon her round
head, and was a curious mixture of white and black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Her robe was covered with figures of cones, hemispheres
and white-topped mountains, which figures were touched
here and there with many bright colors. This was Cumulus.</p>

<p>Elf Stratus wore a grayish robe flounced with bands of
divers colors, many of them edged with bright silver and
golden fringe like the rays of the setting sun. Her dark
hair was worn smooth, and was crossed by a band of
purple ribbons that girdled the crown.</p>

<p>Nimbus, the last of the four sisters, was a gloomy-looking
dame, with a kind look in her eyes nevertheless,
and a great purse in her hand, through the meshes
of which yellow pieces of gold were seen. She was
dressed in black, had a gray cloak with fringed edges
thrown over her shoulders, and a dainty lace cap upon
her head.</p>

<p>"Oho! here you are, then!" cried Madam Breeze as
the Elves came forward. They all bowed as she spoke,
and stood quite still when she ceased. Indeed, the sisters
seemed to be curiously affected by Madam Breeze's
voice; for all the while that she was speaking they
gently swayed their bodies, and moved back and forth
through the cave.</p>

<p>"Come now," said Madam Breeze, "you must be quite
good-natured, you know. I have a very, very important
duty for you. I want to serve my good friends the
Brownies&mdash;wheeze! Here, Ensign, let me present you.
These are the Cloud Elves." Lawe bowed gravely, and
the sisters each made that graceful and dignified courtesy
which our grandmothers were taught to be the
proper thing on such occasions.</p>

<p>"This is what I want," continued Madam Breeze; "to-morrow
morning&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;do you hear me? To-morrow
morning I want to have quite clear. Keep the Gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of the Sun wide open&mdash;hoogh! Wide, I say; for we
have some good work for my Lord Sol to do over there
at Hillside. Stratus, do you hear, lass?&mdash;wheeze! I'm
most afraid of you. You're such a regular night owl,
and affect the manners of&mdash;hoogh!&mdash;of those silly humans
who wake all night and go to bed at sunrise. But,
mark what I say&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;you must stay at home this
night. Not a flounce, not a frill, not a&mdash;hoogh!&mdash;not
a&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;nothing&mdash;(confusion seize this cough!)&mdash;of
all your fine toggery must be spread between
the sun and the gate to-morrow morn. Do you all understand?"</p>

<p>Madam Breeze puffed, and bounded about in a nervous
way, mightily stirred up by the necessity for making
such a long speech. The sisters bowed several times,
and at last Nimbus, who seemed to speak for the others,
answered in a deep voice that rolled through the cave
and sounded like low distant thunder: "We will keep
the gate open, good Mistress Breeze. You know we
are always ready to oblige you. Your pleasure shall be
our law."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;good! Many thanks. Don't forget. If
you do&mdash;bless your hearts!&mdash;I'll blow up Brother
Tempest and have him tear your fine robes into tatters.
Good-bye. Come, Ensign, let us away&mdash;wheeze!"
Once more squeezing herself into scant space, she got
into the chariot.</p>

<p>"Where next?" asked Lawe, when the top of the
cliff had been regained.</p>

<p>"Where, where? Jump in&mdash;quick! Whirlit, Keener,
you rogues, where are you? Oh, you're at your post, are
you?&mdash;wheeze! All right. Go!&mdash;hoogh!"</p>

<p>"Go? Whither?" cried Whirlit, leaping upon Vesper's
back and gathering up the reins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure! I had forgotten; all owing to that vile
asthma! To the falls in the cove. Away!"</p>

<p>A beautiful stream runs through the cove. As it
approaches the river, it hugs the base of the southern
hill, enters a short ravine, midway of which it tumbles
over a rock ten or twelve feet high, making a pretty
waterfall. The sides of the ravine around the cascade
and pool are covered with ferns. Thrifty young
hemlocks stretch their tops upward and interlock their
green branches above.</p>

<p>"What a charming spot! what a cool retreat!" cried
Lawe, as the chariot dashed through an opening in the
foliage, through which the sunlight stole and rested in a
golden plate upon the bosom of the pool.</p>

<p>The face of the pool was rippled and dimpled as
Madam's chariot stopped upon a flat stone at the edge
of the cascade. The waterfall, too, raised a louder
splash and broke its broad sheet into many ribbons and
tongues of water in welcome of the good Elf. Vesper
and Vacuum dipped their beaks thereinto and having
kissed the pool's face, threw up their heads and drank to
the health of Cove Fall and its people.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Madam Breeze. She leaped
from the chariot and ran under the fall. Presently she
returned bringing with her the Fairy Dew, whom she
had come to see. Lawe had never seen a more beautiful
and dainty sprite. Her face and head were covered
with a long white veil which, as well as her gauze robe,
glistened with mimic pearls and diamonds. When she
shook her head or moved her body these jewels were
thrown off in little showers that shone a moment in the
sunbeams, and then melted away into the earth or water.
But there seemed to be none the less of them for all that.
A curious instrument that somewhat resembled Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
bagpipes, hung from her shoulders, and rested under the
left arm. Every moment or two Fairy Dew pressed this
instrument between her arm and side, whereupon, from
a number of little tubes there would issue a cloud of
spray, that settled upon the grass and leaves in minute
round jewels like those which covered the Fairy's
dress.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

title="Fig. 142.&mdash;Fairy Dew at the Mouth of the Cave." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 142.&mdash;Fairy Dew at the Mouth of the Cave.</span>
</div>

<p>Madam Breeze presented the Ensign to the Fairy,
and then in her own jerky way told the story of the
Brownies' troubles. Whereat Dew was sorry and excited,
and shook so many pearl drops around her that
Lawe had to step beyond the circle of the shower to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
save himself from being drenched. That was the Fairy's
way of shedding tears, it would seem.</p>

<p>"What I want you to do," continued the Elf, "is to
be up bright and early to-morrow, and cover the lawn
at Hillside with these pretty gems of yours. The
Pixies&mdash;faugh!&mdash;have their tents spread out like the
camp of Joshua in the plains of Moab. Sprinkle 'em
well&mdash;wheeze! Make every single thread a string of
dew-drops. We'll attend to the rest. What say you,
my dear?&mdash;hoogh!"</p>

<p>"Will the Cloud Elves be at home?" asked the
Fairy.</p>

<p>"Aye,&mdash;I've seen to that. The way'll be clear.
What say you?&mdash;wheeze!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I must consult my husband first, you know.
I can do nothing without Dewpoint. I'll run and ask
him."</p>

<p>"Aha! you're as sweet as ever on that&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;hubby
of yours. Quite&mdash;hoogh!&mdash;right! Go and consult
with Dewpoint."</p>

<p>"May I go in with the Fairy?" asked Lawe, who was
curious to see her home.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," said Dew, "and welcome. Come
in, both of you!"</p>

<p>"Not I, thank you," said the Madam. "Shouldn't
wonder if I had taken my death of cold already&mdash;hoogh!
In with you, Ensign, and hasten back."</p>

<p>The water in leaping over the edge of the precipice
left a space of a foot or more between the falling sheet
and the face of the rock. By this path Lawe passed
under the fall. He noted that the light shone through
the tumbling stream as through a frosted window, and
made every object within visible. Above him was a
roof and beside him a wall of rushing water, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
loud, steady roar, as it fell into the pool, quite drowned
the sound of his voice. In a moment he was drenched
with spray. The stones over which he stepped were wet
and slippery, and compelled careful walking. Presently
Dew stopped before an opening in the rock, and beckoned
Lawe to follow her.</p>

<p>He entered an irregular cave which stretched backward
into the cliff as far as the eye could reach. It was
dark at first, but as soon as his eyes became used to the
change, Lawe could see the objects around the opening,
and faintly those further in. Upon the roof were hanging
stalactites white as sea foam, some tapering to points
and dropping like icicles, some just touching or blending
with like formations called stalagmites, which rose from
various spots upon the floor like marble pillars. These
beautiful white formations were also spread over the
walls of the cave wherever the water had trickled down,
and some of them looked like serpents, or roots of trees
carved in marble.</p>

<p>Far back toward the end of the cave Lawe saw in the
dim light an old-looking Elf, who seemed to be in an
uncomfortable state of mind and body. He was clad as
scantily as propriety would allow, indeed was naked
from the waist up. A long white beard fell upon his
bare breast. He sat upon a rude Gothic chair, not unlike
the big pulpit seat which the minister sits in on Sundays,
which had been formed, by some freak of the cave
Sprites, from the interweaving and massing of stalactites
and stalagmites. He held in his hand a huge fan made
from the feathers of a snow bird, with which he fanned
himself so vigorously that his long beard was blown
about over his chest, and his white hair was kept streaming
behind him. Considering how chilly was the cave,
Lawe thought this strange behavior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is that?" he asked. "He looks like Saint
Nicholas in his summer retreat. Is that your husband?"</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you, no,&mdash;no indeed!" laughed Fairy
Dew. "That is my half brother Frost. He gets little
comfort in this country until winter begins to come on.
He hardly ever goes out of the cave the whole summer,
and keeps back there, as you see, in the coolest spot.
No wonder that he plays some sorry pranks when he is
released in the autumn from his long confinement."</p>

<p>"But he has been out in the summer, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Elf quickly, "he did escape the
guards once or twice and&mdash;dear me! I don't like to
think of it! It was too bad the way he carried on.
The face of the earth looked as if it had been boiled in
a caldron during the night. Farmers and gardeners
were well nigh ruined. They called brother the 'Black
Frost,' after that trick. Though, dear me! I don't see
why, for he's white enough I'm sure. But mortals are
odd and contrary folk sometimes!"</p>

<p>Just then Dewpoint came out of a pavilion or chamber
which was contrived by using stalagmites as pillars
and stalactites as supports. As he stepped forth he
threw back the curtain door, and exposed the interior of
a snug room, lit up with fox-fire lanterns which were
fixed in gnarled stalactite brackets. Lawe was about to
take a closer view of this pretty room and its master,
when he heard the voice of Madam Breeze calling at
the mouth of the cave:</p>

<p>"Ho! Hello, there! Are you frozen up? Have you
taken summer lodgings? Here I've been waiting for&mdash;for&mdash;hoogh!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For three minutes!" answered Lawe a little impatiently,
for he was curious and disappointed. Then he
bethought him of his duties, and spoke up cheerfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
"I am coming! You are quite right, it is no time to
loiter. Thanks for your kind prompting, friend Breeze.
Farewell, good Fairy Dew, and you, Sir Dewpoint, too."
He hastened out of the cave and followed the Elf to the
chariot, which bowled rapidly away from the ravine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p class="chapname">HOW THE MISSION ENDED.</p>


<p>"Whither now?" asked Lawe.</p>

<p>"Home," said Madam Breeze. "We've nothing more
to do but wait for the morning. If all go well, and all
shall go well, never fear! we will see old Spite&mdash;faugh!&mdash;and
all his Pixie crew&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;scattered to the
four winds before morning. Be up bright and early.
You shall find me on hand at daybreak, and by sunrise
Brownieland may proclaim a Jubilee&mdash;hoogh!"</p>

<p>When the chariot reached Lone Aspen, Lawe called
his troopers, and with many warm thanks bade the Elf
good-bye, and hurried back to his former bivouac at the
tip-top of the large Rose Bush. The ponies were tethered
under the leaves out of Pixie sight, and the troopers
stretched themselves upon the branches to sleep, or sat
in the forks of the limbs and talked over old campaigns
until nightfall. Always, however, sentinels kept watch
against surprise. The day passed without alarm, and
when night came on the Brownies composed themselves
to sleep. Lawe, full of anxiety, was sleepless. He had
firm faith that Madam Breeze would bring deliverance,
but as she had not told her plans, he could only guess
what they were from such hints as had been dropped
while arranging matters with her friends. Still, there
was so much doubt in his mind that he could scarcely
compose himself to wait until the morrow. He descended
the bush, dodging on the way the round beautiful snares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
of the Wheel Legion swung among the daisies, and
the criss-cross and knotted nets of the Lineweavers.</p>

</div>

<p>On the ground beneath him a party of Pixie officers
were gossiping over current events. There was Saltus
of the Vaulting Legion, a large-eyed, intelligent fellow,
dressed in a black uniform, with gold and scarlet facings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and a bright metallic green helmet and sword sheath.
He was famous for his long leaps, being able to make at
a single jump the distance of several hundred millimeters.
There also were Lieutenant Heady, and Cito of
the Wolf battalion, and Dysdera of the Tubeweavers, who
lived in a sac-like tent from which the Brownies had
nicknamed him "Pixie Silk-poke." They were all in
high feather, and were making merry
yarns and jokes over the late disasters
which had befallen their enemies.
Lieutenant Heady was in the midst
of a boastful prediction of the utter
ruin of all Brownieland when a
runner arrived with news of the
strange excitement among
the Brownies, and the illumination
of the camp
and ships, as related
in a former chapter.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 144.&mdash;&quot;The Criss-Cross and Knotted Net of the Lineweavers.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"What can
it mean?"
asked Saltus.</p>

<p>"No one
knows," replied the runner.</p>

<p>"P'raps they've got up a big feed and pow-wow for
some pompous general," growled Heady.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Ensign Lawe; and having doubled the
guard, he sped away through the moonlight. When he
came back with the glorious news of the rescue of the
Nurses, his squad of troopers could not restrain their joy,
and broke out with a round of cheers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whew!" cried Cito, "Brownies here, as I live!
After them, lads!" and he ran up the Rose Bush full
speed.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" cried Saltus, leaping upon the leaves,
"mount for them, Vaulters! Jump, jump quickly!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="i145">
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 145.&mdash;&quot;Dysdera of the Tubeweavers.&quot;</span>

<p>"Confusion seize 'em," growled Heady between his
teeth, "I'll put a stopper on your throats, my pretty
chickidees!" Thereupon he swung
himself to a twig and followed his
comrades. But Lawe had taken the
alarm, and betook himself and troopers
to the Virginia creeper above the parlor
window, where they were out of harm's
way.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Now the night passed merrily along.
From the depth of despair the Ensign and his men were
suddenly lifted to the height of joy. The news seemed
too good to be true; moreover, it was like a prophetic
assurance of further good fortune on the morrow. Lawe's
spirits rose to the highest pitch; and when at last he
fell asleep it was to dream of victory, love and Grace.</p>

<p>"Oho, oho! Did I surprise you, Mr. Ensign?" was
the greeting which came to him as he awoke. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
daybreak. There sat Madam Breeze on the Virginia
creeper above him, smiling good-humoredly, and shaking
the vine gently. He hurried to her side, bade her good
morning, and told her the news of Faith and Sophia's
rescue. Madam shook with joyful excitement until the
vine clattered against the wall.</p>

<p>"Hist!" she cried, "that will never do! Silence&mdash;do
you hear? Softly&mdash;hu-sh! We must keep cool
a while longer&mdash;wheeze!" She choked off her cough as
she spoke, and sat still, at least as still as she could sit.</p>

<p>Lawe looked out upon the lawn. There was Fairy
Dew giving the finishing touch to her night's work. As
she flew with quick wings above the grass, her arms
played rapidly upon the sacs beneath them, and from
the many tubes attached thereto the spray flew in all
directions.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Ensign as he watched with
curious interest this fairy spraying machine. "What a
busy little body Fairy Dew must be! See what an immense
work she has wrought during the night!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye! That is what we want. Look how the
dew brings out to view yonder Pixie tents on the lawn
and in the bushes. Ha, ha! Good, indeed!&mdash;wheeze!"
The Elf clapped her hands merrily at the sight. But
Lawe could hardly enter into the pleasure of the view,
for as he saw almost every square foot of his beloved
homestead grounds covered with the tents of his foes,
showing white and clear under their load of dew-drops,
his heart beat tumultuously with grief, shame and anger.
He therefore shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Never mind," cried Madam Breeze, "we shall see
presently. Aha! lookee yonder! There comes the
sun! All is well! Hoogh!&mdash;hurrah!"</p>

<p>The first rays of the rising sun were beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
peep between the Two Pines, touch the tip of the Giantstone's
poll and shoot out across the river.</p>

<p>"Bless the kind Cloud Elves," exclaimed Madam,
"they have served us truly, and left the Gate of the
Sun open wide. Welcome, welcome, good Sol! Here,
this way now, Fairy Sunbeam,
follow me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_146.jpg" width="400" height="432"
alt="Fig. 146.&mdash;Dew-Sprinkled Tents upon the Lawn."
title="Fig. 146.&mdash;Dew-Sprinkled Tents upon the Lawn." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 146.&mdash;Dew-Sprinkled Tents upon the Lawn.</span>
</div>

<p>The Elf tossed herself off
the vine and
bustled away
to the front window that looks toward the northeast,
facing the great bend in the Ohio River. She shook
the window shutter until the slats rattled and fell open.</p>

<p>"In with you now!" she cried to the Sunbeam. "Right
in! Off the floor now, please. Up the white bed-spread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
There&mdash;that is it; that's it! Just the spot, full and fair
in the Governor's face! Now&mdash;wheeze!&mdash;rest there a
moment, will you? I'll finish up these shutters&mdash;hoogh,
wheeze&mdash;<i>puff!</i>"</p>

<p>She laid hold of the green slats and shook them again
and again. Harder, Madam, harder, if you would get
them open! Once more the Elf threw herself against
the barrier, until the window shook.</p>

<p>"Here, Whisk, Keener!" she called. "Come to my
help. And you, Lawe, creep in here and pry up that
catch with your spear. All together, now!&mdash;Whoo-ooo-<i>whooff!</i>"</p>

<p>One of the shutters flew back with a loud bang, and
as good hap would have it, the hasp or catch on the
end thereof struck the leaf on which Lacemaker the
Pixinee was nested and broke it loose from the vine. It
floated off upon the wind and Madam Lacemaker was
sorely tossed about upon her aerial voyage. Seeing this,
a Fairy Sunbeam seized the stem of the leaf and darted
off westward with it. Thereat Elf Keener plunged
away after careering leaf and flying Sunbeam, and with
stout puffs of his breath drove the leaf before him,
Madam Lacemaker all the while tumbling back and
forth, holding on to the lines of her dainty web, and
ever and anon from her kneeling or half-prone posture
shaking her fists, and sputtering forth her helpless
wrath.</p>

<p>Now through the open space the sun sent in a broad
sheet of golden light that fell full upon Wille's face.
The Governor awoke, rubbed his eyes, grumbled at the
wind, grumbled at somebody's carelessness, got out of
bed and crossed the room to close the shutter. Madam
Breeze threw around him the freshest and sweetest
breath of the morning as he approached. He leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
out of the window to draw the truant shutter to its
place. He was wide awake now. The soft sunbeams
fell upon him. He drew a full breath, and sent it forth
again with an "ah&mdash;aa-ah!" of hearty relish.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a glorious morning," he muttered.
"Ah, Nature gives us our sweetest tastes of life, after
all. How still it is here! A real relief from the
excitement and clamor of my life." He stood and gazed
quietly upon the lovely scene before him. His eyes
were fixed upon the rising sun, the glowing hill top
and golden zoned river. A feeling of sadness fell upon
him. It deepened into regret, as he silently looked and
mused. He was thinking,&mdash;and who has not so thought?&mdash;of
the earlier, the purer, the happier morning of life,
ere the ambitions and struggles of manhood had awakened
within him to warm the heart to fever heat, and
taint the freshness and purity of nobler and holier
desires and aims.</p>

<p>"Heigho!" he sighed, as he slowly drew the shutter
to its place.</p>

<p>He felt a light touch upon his hand. A small, thin
voice, but very sweet and familiar, fell upon his ear. It
was the well-known greeting of his Brownie friends.</p>

<p>"God speed, Brother Wille; hail and good speed!"</p>

<p>He looked down, and saw standing upon the window-sill
Ensign Lawe and his troopers.</p>

<p>"Welcome, brothers hail and good speed!" he
answered. There was a heartiness in his tone and
genuine pleasure in his face, which made the hearts of
the fairies jump for joy. It was so like the tone and
look of old time!</p>

<p>"What do you bring me, brothers?" continued
Wille. "What can I do for you, or what will you do
for me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look yonder, please," said Lawe, pointing toward
the lawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 147.&mdash;Fairy Sunbeam and Elf Keener Banishing Madam Lacemaker Beyond the River.</span>
</div>

<p>The Governor leaned over the window-sill and followed
the direction of the Ensign's pointed spear. He started!
The Pixie encampment covered the place! The dew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
drops on the tent-tops were glistening in the sunbeams
like jewels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/fig_148.jpg" width="353" height="500"
alt="Fig. 148.&mdash;A Dew-Laden Web."
title="Fig. 148.&mdash;A Dew-Laden Web." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 148.&mdash;A Dew-Laden Web.</span>
</div>

<p>"Look out of the west window, now," said Lawe.
The Governor threw back the shutter and saw the same
dew-laden webs and silken tents stretching in close array<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
up toward the orchard to the very bank of the lake and
inlet.</p>

<p>"And has it come to this, my good friends?" cried
Wille. His voice trembled, and a tear started upon
his cheek. "Have your old foes driven you from your
homestead, and shut you out from the mansion and from
me? I see, I see! Not another word! I know that it
is my fault. Forgive me! I will right the wrong without
delay. I will, indeed! And Dido will do her best
to help me. Depend on us. When the sun has dried
the dew from the grass, meet us at our old trysting place
by the Rose Bush, and you shall see us scatter the
Pixies, and give back the Home Lawn to my Brownie
brothers. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He lay down again, but could not sleep. His thoughts
were too busy with the past, and too sad, in sooth, to
allow rest. He aroused Dido and told her all. Like a
good wife she heartily sympathized with him in his new
resolves, and agreed to join him in the crusade against
the Pixies.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the two went out to the lawn. "Let
the gardener bring up the lawn mower," said Dido.</p>

<p>"Not I," answered Wille. "I shall do the work myself.
It is quite as little atonement as I can make for
neglecting my old, true Brownie friends."</p>

<p>He threw off his coat, donned his wide-brimmed hat,
and brought the scythe from the tool house. The hone
rung merrily upon the steel as the Governor sharpened
the blade. He had not forgotten his skill of earlier
days, and while he was bringing the scythe to a good
edge his mind followed along the path of his life to the
quiet village among the green hills on the banks of
Little Beaver Creek, where his boyhood had been
spent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>One spot very dear to memory came into view&mdash;Aunt
Fanny's farm! The good, strong face of dear old
Aunt Fanny arose before him. What happy days he
had spent in her quiet country home! He felt again
the thrill of holiday freedom that stirred his young
heart on those summer days when he set out upon the
four miles' walk to the farm. In imagination once
more he passed the old Factory Dam; he saw the water
tumbling over its breast; he stood on the Sandy and
Beaver Canal locks, and watched Sam Underwood and
Ike Clunk pull up their dipnets from the bays. With
what eagerness of interest did he gaze when the net was
swung ashore with a silvery sucker or a pink chub
swaying down the centre!</p>

<p>On, on, along the Elkrun Valley. There is Orr's;
and there is Meldrum's; and there is Charters' farm;
and there is Kimball's mill; and there is Squire Clem
Crow's cooper shop; and yonder is Elkton. One mile
more! The road turns here to the left, winds down the
deep cleft of Pine Hollow, shady the whole summer
long between its sharp ridges crowned with hemlocks,
and musical with the ripple of its clear mountain run.</p>

<p>There is the old District School house!&mdash;and many a
lusty conflict he recalls with the country lads who waged
with him the traditional feud between "country haw-bucks"
and "town boys." Now he climbs up the hill
road; there to the right is the Crow place, and the
Governor smiles as he recalls the easy boyish wit that
dubbed it the "Crow's nest." At last through the trees
comes the longed-for glimpse of the white house on the
knoll, and Aunt Fanny sitting on the porch!</p>

<p>"Hurrah! she rises; she has seen me!"</p>

<p>Up the lane on a run now, and soon at rest before a
bowl of snowy bread and fresh milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>What days those were! full of pleasure from early
rising with the sun to twilight bed-going with the birds.
The wanderings in wood and orchard; the expeditions
after gay field lilies, aromatic calamus and sweet myrrh;
the long hunts after hens' nests in the fence corners;
the walks, musings and amusings among the sheep and
their frisky lambs, the cows and calves, the colts and
piggies, the hens and their yellow puffy broods of muffies;
the big roosters, the speckled guinea fowl,&mdash;how
keen was the zest of these engagements and pursuits!</p>

<p>Then came the warm bright days of harvest, and the
mowers came with their scythes. What fun to toss the
fragrant hay! What glorious fun to see the mowers
run from the stirred up bumble-bees' nest! What fun,
most glorious of all, to fight the insects with wisps of
new mown hay! Ah! the odor of the fresh mown
meadow on dear Aunt Fanny's farm! The Governor
seemed to smell it again, as fresh as on those long past
harvest days, while he stood there whetting his scythe
and living over in memory the scenes of his bright, pure
boyhood.</p>

<p>He drew a deep sigh; he dropped the whetstone into
his hip-pocket; he threw back the scythe, then bent
down to the grass which had so long marred the lawn
by its overgrowth, and swept a broad clean swath up the
hillside.</p>

<p>"You shall not do the work alone," cried Dido, and
seizing her reaping hook began to trim away the
struggling tufts along the border walk.</p>

<p>When Ensign Lawe had received Wille's promise
to break up the Pixie camp and disperse and destroy
the Pixies, he straightway sent messengers to Bruce
and Rodney to follow up the proposed attack. Swiftly
but silently the orders went forth. Fort Home, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
commanded a point of the inlet nearest the Mansion,
was strongly reinforced, and the big david, "Example,"
manned and made ready for use. The ships were cleared
for action, the crews sent to quarters, and all things
made ready for weighing anchor. Never did Soldiers
and Natties await the command with a more cheerful,
willing and confident courage. The rescue of the
Nurses had given them new life; the good news of
Governor Wille's conduct lifted them all into the height
of hope. The battle cry was passed: "Wille, Dido
and Victory!" All was ready. All were waiting.</p>

<p>Now came a trooper dashing post haste into headquarters.
"The Governor has prepared his scythe and
is just advancing to work."</p>

<p>Then came a second courier: "The Governor has
begun the attack; Dido joins him in it!"</p>

<p>A third came: "Wille is cutting a broad swath up
the lawn; the Pixie tents are swept away before him,
and our foes are fleeing in all directions."</p>

<p>Close upon this messenger came Lawe himself, spurring
at topmost speed into the Brownie camp, swinging
his sword around his head in high ecstasy, and crying,
"Forward all! Forward at once! Fall upon the foe,
and we are saved and safe forever!"</p>

<p>"Forward!" cried Bruce.</p>

<p>"Forward!" at the same moment shouted Rodney,
and the signal flag flew to its place.</p>

<p>The ships moved out under a favoring breeze, and
opened full broadsides upon the Stygian vessels. Ensign
Lawe, once more at the head of his gallant troopers, led
across the inlet and dashed at once upon the retreating
Pixies. The footmen poured out of the gates of Fort
Home and marched away to join the attack.</p>

<p>The Governor had now reached the bank of the inlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
and as he swung his scythe merrily, and bowed to the
good work, he was greeted with three times three from
forts and ships:</p>

<p>"Wille, Dido and Victory! Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"</p>

<p>Wille paused a moment and swung his hat above his
head, while Dido waved her handkerchief in recognition
of the Brownie cheers. Then the Governor turned, and
mowed down the lawn, throwing off at each swing of the
scythe a bunch of grass mingled with the ruins of Pixie
tents and huts, whose inmates lay struggling beneath
the wreck of their homes, or fled to the standing grass,
or burrowed and hid around the roots. The Brownies
followed them up, searched them out, dispersed or slew
them. It was a complete destruction and rout. In a few
hours the fragrant grass lay curling in the sun, and not a
Pixie tent was left upon the lawn. Spite and Heady made
a strong effort to rally their soldiers, and succeeded in
forming a line of battle. But the Pixies were so demoralized
that the troops broke and fled before the Brownie
charges. Many found hiding places in holes and dens
of the earth; some escaped in the small boats of the
smugglers and pirates; numbers were taken aboard the
Stygian ships, and were borne down the lake, closely
pursued by the Natties.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Heady lay dead upon the field. What
had become of Spite? When we last saw him he was
sitting alone upon the cliff, filled with rage and wonder
at the Brownie rejoicings over the rescue of Faith and
Sophia, and waiting in the moonlight for the return of
the scouts whom he had sent out to get the news. Not a
whisper of tidings could he hear. Bruce had ordered the
Brownie pickets to keep the matter from their foes, and
no breath of the good news could be gathered from them.
For good and sufficient reasons Raft the smuggler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
had held his knowledge secret, and had kept away
from Spite's presence. His yacht, the Fringe, was now
anchored just under the cliff, hidden from view by the
overhanging grass. Raft had heard for some time the
commotion on the lawn, but gave little heed to it. It
drew nearer. The singing swish of the scythe against
the grass, the cheers of the Brownies and Governor
Wille excited his interest. He climbed up the cliff
and reconnoitered. He took in the situation at a
glance, then turned his eyes toward the inlet. Thereaway
the Nattie fleet was under way, and bearing
down straight toward the cliff.</p>

<p>"It's all up with Pixiedom!" he cried, "for one good
long while at least. Good-bye to the lawn! I'm off
with the Fringe to safe quarters; I wouldn't lose her to
save the whole nation. Every fellow for himself, and
deil take the hindmost! That's good Pixie doctrine, so
here's cut and away!"</p>

<p>He spun out a drag-line, Pixie fashion, and fastening
it to a rock, thereby swung himself down the cliff to
the grass at the water's edge. Thence he boarded the
Fringe, set his sail, pulled up anchor, and was just about
leaving the harbor, when a shower of sand and small
pebbles rolled upon him. He looked up, and saw a
Pixie officer lowering himself down the side of the cliff
by blades of grass and ferns. The form seemed familiar;
he looked more closely. Yes, it was Spite the Spy.</p>

<p>"Hold on,&mdash;hold!" cried Spite.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" answered Raft. "This way now&mdash;down
that tall rush&mdash;so! Now swing upon the mast. There,&mdash;you're
safe. All right!" He unmoored the yacht,
and pushing against the cliff sent her out with one vigorous
shove into clear water. The wind caught the sails,
and the Fringe flew merrily over the surface of Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Katrine. Raft now had leisure to give some attention
to his chief. Spite had thrown himself upon the deck,
and was fairly panting with fatigue, and livid and
trembling with passion. Wrath, terror, disappointment,
shame were in turn and in quick succession reflected
from his face. The smuggler had little love for the
chief, but he pitied him now, and in his rough way
tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Better luck next time, Cap'n," he said. "We've
had many a backset before, and have come out all right
again. Cheer up!"</p>

<p>"Backset, indeed!" growled Spite. "It's annihilation!
There's not enough left of Pixiedom to make a
decent funeral. But&mdash;" and he rolled out a string of
oaths&mdash;"I shall have such revenge as they little dream
of! I'll tear the accursed Nurses limb from limb and
fling the pieces into the Brownie camp! Say! what are
you putting her head down the lake for?" he shouted,
suddenly starting to his feet.</p>

<p>"That's the way of safety, Sir," answered Raft.
"We must make for the outlet or Orchard Cave at
once. Look there at the Natties hard upon the wake
of our fleet. We must get out of their way, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Curse the Natties!" answered Spite fiercely; "and
confound you for a coward! Put her toward Ellen's
Isle, I say! I will land there if the whole Nattie fleet
were following us. But they'll not bother us now; they
have better game at present than the Fringe."</p>

<p>Raft's cheeks burned at the word "coward," and he
could hardly refrain from tossing Spite overboard. But
even the worst of Pixies have some reverence for a chief,
and Raft was one of the best. Besides, he really pitied
Spite, and was willing to allow for his bitter disappointment.
He saw that he had not yet heard of the escape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
the Nurses, and resolved that he would tell him now, so
that he might be persuaded to give up the trip to Ellen's
Isle. It was pretty hard to get started, however, with the
story. Raft hemmed, stammered, and at last began:</p>

<p>"Cap'n, there's no use going to the island now. All's
up, there, as well&mdash;"</p>

<p>Spite interrupted him. "No use? What is that to
you? Do as you are bidden, and do not dare to question
or comment upon my orders. Change her course at once,
or&mdash;or&mdash;" he fairly screamed these words, and stopped
suddenly in the midst of his threat, choked by passion.</p>

<p>Raft trembled with anger. He dropped the helm,
laid hold upon a marline-spike and advanced toward the
chief. Then he suddenly changed his mind, and retraced
his steps.</p>

<p>"Very good," he answered quietly. "You shall
have your own sweet way, my dear! Ellen's Isle it
is!" He pressed his tiller and shifted the sail; the
Fringe swung around, and in a few moments was quietly
riding in one of the secluded harbors with which the
smuggler was familiar, at the head of the island, and
not far from the cave of Tigrina and Aranea Hall.</p>

<p>"Wait here until I return," said Spite leaping ashore.
"I shall be back soon."</p>

<p>There was a strange look in Raft's eye, that caught
the chief's attention, for in a moment he turned back,
and shaking his clenched hand at the smuggler, said:</p>

<p>"If you fail me, I'll follow you to the ends of the
earth and drink your heart's blood! If you prove true
you shall be Admiral of the fleet. Beware!" He
turned again and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>"Admiral!" sneered Raft, when Spite had disappeared.
"Admiral, indeed! That sounds grand, verily.
But I wouldn't stand the fury of his wrath and disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
to be the chief himself. That is, even if&mdash;"
Raft shook his head, and glanced toward the cave.
"However, he would have his own way, and he may find
out for himself how much better it is than the one Raft
advised." He pushed the Fringe out of the harbor, and
spreading full sail ran rapidly toward the outlet.</p>

<p>Let us follow Spite. He came to the door of the cave
without noting any signs of the Brownies' recent camp
in the neighborhood. He found the door fastened on
the outside. What could that mean?</p>

<p>"Curses on the old hag Tigrina," he cried, "she is out
on some expedition, and has left the Nurses locked
within. Well, they're safe enough under these fastenings,"
he muttered, as he cut away the thongs, "and I'll
have the Brownie beauties all to myself. But I'll flay
the vile hag alive for this disobedience. It's time that
I were rid of her, at any rate."</p>

<p>The strong fastenings which the Brownies had put
upon the door were at length removed, and Spite entered
the cave. All was as still as the grave. Not a sound
from the bright and busy world without fell inside those
silent halls. He pushed on. The fox-fire lights had
burned out. He was well used to groping in the dark,
but he could scarcely make out the objects before him.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he called.</p>

<p>The echoes of his voice rolled back upon him again
and again from either end of the cave. A strange sensation
came over him. His heart began to quicken; a
cold chill seized him. He threw off the feeling. He
cursed his timidity and superstition. "On, on!" he
cried. "Revenge is near." He reached the silken curtain
that formed the door of the fairies' room. He drew
it aside, gloating over the thought of the terror which
his sudden appearance would excite. A single lantern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
burned upon the wall, and by its light he saw that the
room was empty! Signs of confusion were everywhere.
The stand lay just where it had fallen, and under it the
"Wisdom of the Pixies" was outspread upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Faith! Sophia!" he shouted. The voice died away
among the arches. There was a faint noise at his side.
He turned quickly. There stood Tigrina. Her face
was gaunt, her cheeks hollow, her eyes burned like balls
of fire.</p>

<p>"Hag! fiend! wretch!" yelled Spite. "What have
you done with the Nurses?" He drew his sword and
took a step toward the old Pixinee.</p>

<p>"Oho!" said Tigrina, uttering a harsh cackling
laugh. "You have come at last, have you? The
pretty Nurses! Where are they? Ha, ha, ha! That
is good&mdash;good! You didn't know that the Brownies
had been here, hey? Didn't know that Faith and
Sophia are safe in the Brownie camp, hey? Oh, no!
that is very good&mdash;very! You didn't know that I had
been left here sealed up in the cave&mdash;oh, no, not you!"</p>

<p>Spite stopped, then staggered backward as though he
had been struck a violent blow. The whole truth flashed
upon him. He understood now the mysterious outburst
of joy in Brownie camp and fleet. Faith and Sophia
were gone,&mdash;safe from his power and revenge among
their own friends! Fortune had again failed him.
His breast was torn by a tempest of passions. This
last defeat was even worse than the loss of his camp
and the rout of his army. He broke forth into wild,
blasphemous reproaches of Tigrina for failing to keep
the fairies in her charge. Again he lifted his sword
and again he started toward the Pixinee.</p>

<p>There was something in the attitude of Tigrina which
caused him suddenly to pause. Her eyes shone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
dim light of the cave; her sharp, long fangs swayed
back and forth, touching each other with a grating
sound; her back curved; she sank into a stooping
posture. Spite felt her hot breath strike his face as it
hissed through her clattering teeth. He knew too well
what all this meant. The "blind fury" had seized the
Pixinee!</p>

<p>Fly, Spite, fly! It is for your life!</p>

<p>He turns, flees! Too late! The rush of Tigrina's
form is heard as she springs upon the doomed chief.
Her fangs are fastened in his throat. He is borne down
to the floor, and without a struggle and without a cry
he yields up his life. The enraged and hungry Pixinee
drank up his blood, and left the dry carcass hung against
the wall by broken strands of web-work, to moulder
into dust with the silken ornaments of Aranea Hall.</p>

<p>Summer passed. Autumn came and hung her gaily
colored banners upon the trees and shrubbery of Hillside.
The Brownies dwelt in peace upon the lawn, and Governor
Wille and Dido held the Mansion with happier
hearts than ever. The winds blew more and more
keenly around the hills. The Fall had well nigh
merged into Winter. Thanksgiving day came. Great
preparations had been making at the Mansion, and now
the family meeting was being held. Gray-haired sires,
strong men and matrons, and fair-haired children, down
to crowing baby Paul, all were there. How the halls
rang with merry-making! What a happy, hearty
company sat down to the Thanksgiving dinner!</p>

</div>

<p>It was a bright crisp day, and when dinner was over,
all went out upon the lawn and gathered around the
great Rose Bush. There was a quadruple wedding in
Brownieland: Lieutenant MacWhirlie and Agatha,
Adjutant Blythe and Faith, Sergeant True and Sophia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Ensign Lawe and Grace, all stood up together, and
were joined in holy wedlock according to the simple
rites of the Brownies. Then, amid shouts of the children,
cheers of the older folk, and the wildest hurrahs
of Brownie soldiers, sailors and people all, the eight
happy fairies rode away, escorted by a gaily uniformed
troop, to the Lone Aspen, where Madam Breeze had
prepared for them a grand reception. Fairy Dew and
Dewpoint were there, and the four sister Cloud Elves,
and Whisk, Keener and Whirlit, and before the merrymaking
ended, even Elf Frost looked in, quite happy to
be once more free to roam abroad.</p>

<p>As the evening was fine, and the moon full, Commodore
Rodney and Pipe the Boatswain arranged to give
the party a reception on the Emma and a moonlight
sail upon the lake. The sailors had beautifully decorated
the ship; fox-fire lanterns gleamed from every
part of the forts, and shone all along the shore. Our
old friends Captain Ask, Help, Clearview, Mate Angel,
Howard, Hope, Rise, Shine, the Twadeils and many
others were aboard. The wind was fresh and the lake
was a little rough, but that only made matters all the
merrier. How the ship did scud along!</p>

<p>It was passing the Point of Ellen's Isle, when suddenly
a small vessel pushed out from the brown grasses
at the water's edge, crossed the wake of the Emma
within a stone's throw, and stood away toward the shore.</p>

<p>"Sophie, Sophie!" cried Faith, "look yonder! Do
you know that yacht?"</p>

<p>Sophia glanced a moment at the beautiful vessel as it
rose and fell on the waves and sped swiftly through the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"It is the Fringe!" she cried. "And there&mdash;see!
There is Raft the Smuggler. He has raised his hat!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
He is waving it. Hurrah! hurrah!" Perhaps had she
stopped a moment to ask whether or not such conduct
were orthodox in a Brownie bride, she would not have
done it, but she simply gave way to the impulse of her
heart; she plucked her bridal veil from her head and,
quite unconscious of what she did, waved it again and
again at the fast flying yacht.</p>

<p>The Natties had sprung to their guns at the Fringe's
appearance, prepared to pour a broadside into her; but
when they saw Sophia's greeting and heard her shout,
they took their cue from her, and
instead of shot sent cheers after
the smuggler and his pretty craft.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_2" id="Note_A_2"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_14">p. 14.</a></b>&mdash;Atypus piceus is a European species of
Tunnelweaver (Territelariæ), which inhabits Great Britain. It
resembles in habit our Atypus Abbotii, the Purse-web spider,
found in the Gulf States, especially Florida; but supports its
external tube upon the trunks of trees, instead of on the grass
or surface.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_2" id="Note_B_2"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_16">p. 16.</a></b>&mdash;Spiders are extremely cleanly in their habits,
and brush and comb the various parts of the body with their
hairy and spinous legs and palps. When brushing the head
and chest (cephalothorax) the resemblance to the cat's toilet
habits warrants the reference in the text.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_2" id="Note_C_2"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_18">p. 18.</a></b>&mdash;Some of our American spider species have
been imported from Europe, and I have seen them on vessels
stowed away in divers crannies and under sundry parts of the
ship, and overspun in the method attributed to Spite and his
companions, and shown <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15.</a></p>


<p class="chapname"><a href="#CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_3" id="Note_A_3"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_22">p. 22.</a></b>&mdash;Epeïra globosa is a species of Orbweaver,
which spins above its round snare a bell-shaped silken tent,
represented at <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, <a href="#Page_21">p. 21.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_B_3" id="Note_B_3"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_22">p. 22.</a></b>&mdash;One of the most common webs spun upon
grass, on box-wood borders of flower beds, on arbor vitæ
hedges, and such like positions, is that of the Speckled Tubeweaver,
Agalena nævia, here described. It is a broad sheet,
usually concave or funnel-shaped, with a circular opening near
the middle or at one side, which leads into a long silken tube
extending downward among the branches, or to the ground.
At the opening the spider is usually seen waiting for prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Lines are attached to the sheet at various parts and reach upwards
to bits of foliage, forming a network of lines which support the
sheet. Insects in flight strike against these cross lines, and fall
down upon the sheet, and become the prey of the Speckled Agalena
who rushes upon them from the opening of her tube.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_3" id="Note_C_3"></a><b>Note_C, <a href="#Page_24">p. 24.</a></b>&mdash;The cables here referred to are the upright
lines described in <a href="#Note_B_3">Note B</a>. (See <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>, <a href="#Page_54">p. 54.</a>)</p>

<p><a name="Note_D_3" id="Note_D_3"></a><b>Note D, <a href="#Page_26">p. 26.</a></b>&mdash;The turret of Lycosa arenicola, is here described.
It is popularly known as the Turret Spider. This
animal is widely distributed throughout the United States, and
may be found along the Atlantic shore where it burrows in the
sand, and sometimes selects small pebbles for the foundation
of its tower. The shape of the tower is not always a regular
pentagon, but inclines to take that form. Beneath the surface
is a tubular burrow extending straight down as far sometimes
as twelve inches. The spider is frequently found on guard at
the top of the tower.</p>

<p><a name="Note_E_3" id="Note_E_3"></a><b>Note E, <a href="#Page_26">p. 26.</a></b>&mdash;See <a href="#Note_A_3">Note A</a> above. The web of the Speckled
Agalena when spun upon grass often takes this form and shows
a striking likeness to a miniature circus tent.</p>

<p><a name="Note_F_3" id="Note_F_3"></a><b>Note F, <a href="#Page_27">p. 27.</a></b>&mdash;The Turret Spider is sometimes seen at the
summit of its tower with head and fore limbs thrust over the
edge, apparently on the lookout for passing insects.</p>

<p><a name="Note_G_3" id="Note_G_3"></a><b>Note G, <a href="#Page_35">p. 35.</a></b>&mdash;The above description and <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a> are of
the cocoon of the large and beautiful Orbweaver Argiope cophinania
(or riparia). It is a pear-shaped object about an inch or
an inch-and-a-quarter long, and is suspended in the manner
shown, among the branches of bushes, etc. The outside is a
closely woven silken cloth of a dull yellow color. Next to this
is a coating of bright yellow flossy silk, and in the centre is a
closely woven ball of purplish or brownish silk, within which
may be found the eggs of the mother spider. These sometimes
number more than a thousand. When the little ones are
hatched out, they live within this silken house until they are
strong and old enough to cut their way out and form webs for
themselves.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_6" id="Note_A_6"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_52">p. 52.</a></b>&mdash;The lodge here referred to as used for a
guard house by the Pixies, is supposed to be a snare of the
Speckled Agalena, which often spins its tent-like web upon the
low grass of a lawn. <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a> shows a web spun upon a honeysuckle
vine, whose over-arching tendrils form a little cavern or
booth which might well suggest a lodge.</p>


<p class="chapname"><a href="#CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_7" id="Note_A_7"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62.</a></b>&mdash;Spider webs are often destroyed or injured
by wind storms.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_7" id="Note_B_7"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62.</a></b>&mdash;A common habit of ground spiders and
those that weave snares upon the ground is to thus hide themselves
when molested or alarmed.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_7" id="Note_C_7"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_67">p. 67.</a></b>&mdash;"Hand over hand." This roughly describes
the method of some spiders in raising their prey when
swathed, and in moving building material and debris.</p>

<p><a name="Note_D_7" id="Note_D_7"></a><b>Note D, <a href="#Page_69">p. 69.</a></b>&mdash;See Note C. The figure is from life.</p>

<p><a name="Note_E_7" id="Note_E_7"></a><b>Note E, <a href="#Page_73">p. 73.</a></b>&mdash;The achievement attributed to Spite is
based upon a recorded account; but the author is bound to say
that he has seen no examples of webs that had been counterpoised
with intent, as above described. Webs are sometimes
found thus balanced as at <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>; but it is doubtful if this is
not the result of accident.</p>


<p class="chapname"><a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_8" id="Note_A_8"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_75">p. 75.</a></b>&mdash;The mandibles or external jaws of spiders
are shown in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>, and described in the text; the poison
gland is shown at <a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>. The outlet for the poison may be
seen at the tip of the fangs in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_9" id="Note_A_9"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_84">p. 84.</a></b>&mdash;Certain species, especially Orbweavers
(<a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a>) and Lineweavers, swathe their prey when captured and
before eaten. (See <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>; <a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a>, <a href="#Page_318">p. 318</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_9" id="Note_B_9"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_88">p. 88.</a></b>&mdash;The bridge-lines here described are common
objects in Nature. Spiders move freely from point to point,
thereby often crossing considerable intervals. <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a> shows
the way in which these bridges and webs may block a path.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_10" id="Note_A_10"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_97">p. 97.</a></b>&mdash;The egg-bag within which the mother
spider places her eggs is popularly, though not quite correctly,
called a cocoon. It is sometimes simply a wad or ball of loose
silk, but more frequently is a bag of stiff and closely woven
silk as at <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>. <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a> is the cocoon of an Orbweaver,
Nephila plumipes; <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>, of a Saltigrade or Jumping Spider,
Phidippus opifex <span class="smcap">McCook</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_13" id="Note_A_13"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_115">p. 115.</a></b>&mdash;Dolomedes fimbriatus, a rather common
English spider, makes or utilizes a rude raft of leaves, and
drifts over the fens thereon. The American Dolomedes frequents
the water but has not been observed to act as above.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_13" id="Note_B_13"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_117">p. 117.</a></b>&mdash;As a rule spiders prey upon one another,
without regard to species or sex. <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a> represents two males
fighting.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_14" id="Note_A_14"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_123">p. 123.</a></b>&mdash;Lycosa tigrina <span class="smcap">McCook</span> abounds in the
Eastern and Middle United States, and makes the burrow here
described.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_15" id="Note_A_15"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_128">p. 128.</a></b>&mdash;Herpyllus ecclesiasticus <span class="smcap">Hentz</span> is a common
American Tubeweaver. It is black, with a dorsal pattern
in white like that shown in the figure of the "Pixie parson."</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_15" id="Note_B_15"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_135">p. 135.</a></b>&mdash;The aeronautic or ballooning habit of
spiders is the basis of these engineering feats of the Pixies
Lycosa and Gossamer. A pleasant October day is the best on
which to observe it; but young spiders may be seen in aeronautic
flight during all warm months. An elevated spot is usually
sought from which to make the ascent. Ground spiders, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Lycosids, ascend in the manner shown <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>; Orbweavers
drift off as at <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>. This interesting habit is described more
at length in my "Tenants of an Old Farm."</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_15" id="Note_C_15"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_137">p. 137.</a></b>&mdash;Mother spiders of certain species carry
their egg cocoons until the young are hatched; some take them
in their jaws as our long-legged cellar spider, Pholcus, others
beneath their bodies or lashed to the end of the abdomen.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_16" id="Note_A_16"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_144">p. 144.</a></b>&mdash;Tetragnatha is a genus which has several
common species in the United States and Europe, T. extensa
being most familiar. Its colors, especially when young, are
green and yellow, and when its long body and legs are stretched
upon a leaf or twig (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>) it is difficult to detect it. The
species here personified is one that keeps close to streams and
ponds, Tetragnatha grallator <span class="smcap">Hentz</span>, the Stilt spider. The
method of sailing, <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>, is not imaginative but drawn from
nature. The Pixie "Sixpoint" is a Citigrade spider, Dolomedes
sexpunctatus <span class="smcap">Hentz</span>. I have known it to stay under
water for forty minutes.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_17" id="Note_A_17"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_153">p. 153.</a></b>&mdash;Many Orbweavers spin together several
leaves, or roll up the end of a single leaf and form the nests
described and shown, <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>. That at <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>, <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, was

spider of Europe, Argyroneta aquatica, makes a cocoon upon
the water, somewhat in the manner described. No species with
like habits has yet been discovered in America, and the author
in locating the same at "Hillside," has sacrificed the facts of
geographical distribution to imagination. But no doubt he will
be pardoned for the sake of the incident which brings the lost
Boatswain Pipe to life again.</p>

drawn from a snare of Linyphia communis <span class="smcap">Hentz</span>, woven
among morning glories. Compare with that of Linyphia marginata
<span class="smcap">Hentz</span>, <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>, <a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>, in which the bowl is reversed.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_27" id="Note_A_27"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_270">p. 270.</a></b>&mdash;The Trap-doors drawn at <a href="#Fig_117">Figs. 117</a>, <a href="#Fig_118">118</a>
and <a href="#Fig_121">121</a> are from Moggridge, and are not of American species,
though they differ only in size.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_27" id="Note_B_27"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271.</a></b>&mdash;This habit has been attributed to the
Trap-door makers, but needs to be confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_27" id="Note_C_27"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_275">p. 275.</a></b>&mdash;The mother wasp, which lances and paralyzes
the big southwestern Tarantula, Eurypelma Hentzii, is
Pepsis formosa, called popularly the "Tarantula hawk." The
author has seen it pursuing the above species, but does not
know positively that it attacks the true Trap-door maker, Cteniza
Californica.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_28" id="Note_A_28"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_280">p. 280.</a></b>&mdash;This is no doubt a true representation;
see the three claw marks on the inside of the lid shown at <a href="#Fig_124">Fig.
124</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_28" id="Note_B_28"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_284">p. 284.</a></b>&mdash;The moulting period (see next Chapter),
is attended with great weakness.</p>

<p><a name="Note_A_29" id="Note_A_29"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_290">p. 290.</a></b>&mdash;The sting of the spider collecting wasps
destroys the power of motion, but does not at once kill; it is
certainly fatal in the end, if the young wasp larva does not in
the meantime eat the victim stored away for her by maternal
foresight.</p>


<p class="chapname"><a href="#CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_30" id="Note_A_30"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_309">p. 309.</a></b>&mdash;Spiders have been known to thus suspend a
snake, which is not so remarkable as it seems if we consider that
a small garter snake ten inches long may weigh from one-eighth
to one-fourth of an ounce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Note_B_30" id="Note_B_30"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_313">p. 313.</a></b>&mdash;The Medicinal spider, Tegenaria medicinalis
<span class="smcap">Hentz</span>, builds in cellars and shady spots a strong sheeted
web with a tower at one angle thereof.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_30" id="Note_C_30"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_314">p. 314.</a></b>&mdash;The capture of a mouse in a spider web
has been proved, at least to the author's satisfaction. <a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>
is a sketch of such a captive made by Governor Proctor Knott,
of Kentucky.</p>

<p><a name="Note_D_30" id="Note_D_30"></a><b>Note D, <a href="#Page_319">p. 319.</a></b>&mdash;This "fish story" is quite true. The
incident occurred in a draining ditch near Eagleswood, New
Jersey. The fish was three and one-fourth inches long and
weighed sixty-six grains; the spider was three-fourths of an
inch long and weighed fourteen grains. It was one of our
large Lycosids, probably a Dolomedes The facts on which the
incidents of this chapter are based, are given in Vol. I, "American
Spiders and their Spinningwork."</p>


<p class="chapname"><a href="#CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></p>

<p><a name="Note_A_31" id="Note_A_31"></a><b>Note A, <a href="#Page_324">p. 324.</a></b>&mdash;Most species of Spiders are solitary in
their habits; not like the social hymenoptera, as bees and ants.
In this respect, the social characteristics of the Pixies are not
true to nature, except in the case of spiderlings, or quite young
spiders. However, some recent discoveries, especially those of
the eminent French araneologist, M. Eugene Simon, seem to
point to a decided social habit in several South American
species.</p>

<p><a name="Note_B_31" id="Note_B_31"></a><b>Note B, <a href="#Page_329">p. 329.</a></b>&mdash;This nest, so much like a bird's in form,
is that of Lycosa Carolinensis. It is made from the needle-like
leaves of the white pine, or other available material by bending
and pasting the same, as in the cut, <a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Note_C_31" id="Note_C_31"></a><b>Note C, <a href="#Page_330">p. 330.</a></b>&mdash;The snares of Agalenanævia are often
seen in such situations, and are sometimes of immense size.</p>

<p><a name="Note_D_31" id="Note_D_31"></a><b>Note D, <a href="#Page_331">p. 331.</a></b>&mdash;The belief that spiders can prognosticate
the weather is widely spread, but seems to have little or no
basis in fact. The author has shown the groundlessness of the
opinion at least in the case of Orbweaving Spiders.</p>

<h2>TENANTS OF AN OLD FARM.</h2>


<p class="center">PRESS NOTICES.</p>

<p>The following extracts from reviews of this book show with what
cordiality it has been received and how highly it is ranked by the
reviewers:</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p>"His enthusiasm in behalf of his industrious friends is so great that he
actually pitched his tent in the midst of the huge mounds of certain
species in one of the Western States, and had to engage a small army of
three men to drive off the attack of the indignant insects while he was
studying the interior arrangements of their elaborately constructed
houses."&mdash;From <i>Chambers' Journal</i> (Edinburgh, Scotland).</p>

<p>"Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> has literally lived among his pets, has studied them by
day and by night in their natural state, has not scrupled to subject himself
to their formidable stings, and has deemed no pains too great to make the
world acquainted with insects upon which he looks with a species of respectful
veneration. He is, in truth, a veritable enthusiast, and it would
indeed seem as though ants, bees and wasps, all belonging to the same
order of insects, possessed a fascination for the true naturalist far greater
than that excited by larger animals."&mdash;<i>The Westminster Review</i> (British).</p>

<p>"Full of curious information, principally on the habits of ants, bees
and other insects."&mdash;<i>Buffalo Courier.</i></p>

<p>"The reading of a few pages in this work will serve as an admirable
preparation for a stroll through fields and over hills in the country during
a Sunday afternoon."&mdash;<i>Times-Star, Cincinnati.</i></p>

<p>"Probably there is no one in America who is better fitted to guide the
young in the study of his sphere of natural history, than the Rev. Dr.
<span class="smcap">Henry C. McCook</span>, of Philadelphia."&mdash;<i>S. S. Times.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> is an authority in all that relates to ants and spiders;
but the talks in this pleasant volume are not restricted to insects of these
varieties, but include interesting and valuable instruction concerning
many other forms of insect life."&mdash;<i>Portland Press, Me.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> is an enthusiastic naturalist, and in one particular
branch of study&mdash;that of the habits of ants and spiders&mdash;stands as high
as any living writer, either English or American."&mdash;<i>Boston Evening
Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"Never read such a fascinating work of natural history."&mdash;<i>Messiah's
Herald, Boston.</i></p>

<p>"Is set forth with a clearness, a simplicity and often with a quaint
humor that make it thoroughly fascinating in the reading."&mdash;<i>Boston Saturday
Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The common insects take on an aspect of genuine interest in Dr.
<span class="smcap">Henry McCook's</span> Tenants of An Old Farm. He describes the life and
habits of spiders, ants, hornets and our dreaded moths, potato-bugs and
canker worms in an easy conversational style."&mdash;<i>Springfield (Mass.) Republican.</i></p>

<p>"Contains the results of a series of carefully conducted observations
on different species of insects, their dispositions and habits, all of which
are detailed in such a familiar and winning style that no one can fail to
be fascinated with the study."&mdash;<i>New York Observer.</i></p>

<p>"The author contrives moreover to convey not only information, but
some measure of his own enthusiasm, and whoever reads his book is
likely to be thenceforth more alert to the marvels and miracles of insect
life."&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"When one possesses the power of vitalizing the bones of science as
Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> does, there are few who will not yield to the charm."&mdash;<i>Yale
Literary Magazine.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Belongs to a class which might with great profit take the place of
much of the literature, sentimental and otherwise, which finds its way
into the hands of our children through Sunday School and other libraries.
It is pleasantly written and beautifully illustrated with original
drawings from nature."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Examiner.</i></p>

<p>"We will venture to say that the Colorado beetle, the apple-worm,
moths, bumble-bees, caterpillars, ants and spiders, were never before
made so picturesque, never so idealized. The author likes them, humanizes
them, lives among them, finds an inner meaning in their little
lives, makes in every way the most of them.... Housekeepers will
surely be amused and probably surprised by learning just how moths go
to work, and the chapters on crickets and katy-dids are very fresh and
animated; the same is true of the bumble-bees and spiders; and what is
not really new is put in new shape."&mdash;<i>Boston Literary World.</i></p>

<p>"The illustrations, 140 in number, were prepared expressly for the
work, are finely engraved, and are a great aid to a clearer understanding
of the text."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Evening Call.</i></p>

<p>"We wish that our farmers, who are giving their sons a Christmas
present, would choose this book. It would help them to see many things
to which they may now be blind."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian, Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p>"Heartily recommended to the attention of all who are themselves interested
in natural history or are seeking some means of interesting
young friends in this subject."&mdash;<i>Portland Press, Me.</i></p>

<p>"We have not seen any book this season more worthy to be put into
the hands of an intelligent youth, or indeed of any one who is interested
in the direct and face-to-face study of nature."&mdash;<i>Illustrated Christian
Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"Of the highest order of interest. The author has made studies and
drawings of the insects which can be found on any old farm, and has
made discoveries which give him a high place among entomologists."&mdash;<i>Chicago
Advance.</i></p>

<p>"May be said to be a perpetual passport to the minor kingdoms of nature.
It is the work of an accomplished and practical naturalist who is
hand and glove (so to speak) with the populace of the leaves and
fields, the woods and waters."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> has already achieved an enviable reputation by his valuable
contributions to science, and in this charming book, so full of
amusement and instruction, he has given us another proof of his being
one of the most clear, concise and attractive writers of the day."&mdash;<i>Christian
at Work, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"It is well known that Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> is one of the few ministers among
us who have made a specialty of studies in the natural sciences, and that
he has in this line built up an enviable reputation beyond our church
and beyond our land."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian Journal, Phila.</i></p>

<p>"The illustrations are a noteworthy feature of the book. Many of them
are admirable illustrations of their subjects, while to these have been
added a number of comical adaptations from the pencil of Mr. <span class="smcap">Dan
Beard</span>."&mdash;<i>Illustrated Christian Weekly, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"The scientific accuracy, the good illustrations and simple descriptions
make it a valuable book for amateurs and a good book of reference for
advanced students in that department of natural history."&mdash;<i>Springfield
Republican.</i></p>

<p>"The author is not a mere compiler of other men's labors; he is a
close and patient observer, and his book has an original value."&mdash;<i>N. Y.
Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>"He is rarely qualified for the task."&mdash;<i>Troy Daily Times.</i></p>

<p>"Scientifically, Dr. <span class="smcap">McCook</span> is authority on all these matters."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian,
Philadelphia.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>
